At each moment of time we will index the cars from the head of the train, starting from 1 1 . Note that when adding new cars to the head of the train, the indexing of the old ones may shift. To choose which car to go in, Vasya will use the value A i A for each car (where i i is a car index), which is calculated as follows: At the beginning of the trip A i =0 A , as well as for the new cars at the time of their addition. During the next recalculation Vasya chooses some positive integers b b and s s and adds to all A i A value b+(i1)_ b . Vasya hasn't decided yet where he will get on the train and where will get off the train, so after each event of one of the three types he wants to know the least index of the car, such that its value A i A is minimal.

2277,"In the spirit of the holidays, Saitama has given Genos two grid paths of length n (a weird gift even by Saitama's standards). A grid path is an ordered sequence of neighbouring squares in an infinite grid. Two squares are neighbouring if they share a side. One example of a grid path is (0,0)__(0,1)__(0,2)__(1,2)__(1,1)__(0,1)__(-1,1). Note that squares in this sequence might be repeated, i.e. path has self intersections. Movement within a grid path is restricted to adjacent squares within the sequence. That is, from the i-th square, one can only move to the (i-1)-th or (i+1)-th squares of this path. Note that there is only a single valid move from the first and last squares of a grid path. Also note, that even if there is some j-th square of the path that coincides with the i-th square, only moves to (i-1)-th and (i+1)-th squares are available. For example, from the second square in the above sequence, one can only move to either the first or third squares. To ensure that movement is not ambiguous, the two grid paths will not have an alternating sequence of three squares. For example, a contiguous subsequence (0,0)__(0,1)__(0,0) cannot occur in a valid grid path. One marble is placed on the first square of each grid path. Genos wants to get both marbles to the last square of each grid path. However, there is a catch. Whenever he moves one marble, the other marble will copy its movement if possible. For instance, if one marble moves east, then the other marble will try and move east as well. By try, we mean if moving east is a valid move, then the marble will move east. Moving north increases the second coordinate by 1, while moving south decreases it by 1. Similarly, moving east increases first coordinate by 1, while moving west decreases it. Given these two valid grid paths, Genos wants to know if it is possible to move both marbles to the ends of their respective paths. That is, if it is possible to move the marbles such that both marbles rest on the last square of their respective paths."," The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2_____1000000)   the length of the paths.

The vertices are numbered with integers from 1 to n, the edges are numbered with integers from 1 to m. Each edge can be unpainted or be painted in one of the k colors, which are numbered with integers from 1 to k. Initially, none of the edges is painted in any of the colors.

A problem is that the function uses itself in the definition. That is why it is hard to calculate.

3373,"Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array a with indices from [l,_) can be implemented as follows: If the segment [l,_) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any i such that l___<_-1 a[i]___[i+1]), then end the function call; Let ; Call mergesort(a,_,_id); Call mergesort(a,_id,_); Merge segments [l,_id) and [mid,_), making the segment [l,_) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. The array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call mergesort(a,0,_). The number of calls of function mergesort is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if a={1,2,3,4}, then there will be 1 call of mergesort   mergesort(0,4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If a={2,1,3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call mergesort(0,3), which then sets mid=1 and calls mergesort(0,1) and mergesort(1,3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,1) and (1,3) are sorted. Ivan has implemented the program that counts the number of mergesort calls, but now he needs to test it.

There are three types of conveyor belts: ""^"", ""<"" and "">"". A ""^"" belt can bring things upwards. ""<"" can bring leftwards and "">"" can bring rightwards. Let's number the rows with 1 to n from top to bottom, the columns with 1 to m from left to right. We consider the seats above and below the top of the table are rows 0 and n+1 respectively. Also we define seats to the left of the table and to the right of the table to be column 0 and m+1. Due to the conveyor belts direction restriction there are currently no way for a diner sitting in the row n+1 to be served. Given the initial table, there will be q events in order. There are two types of events: ""A x y"" means, a piece of bread will appear at row x and column y (we will denote such position as (x,_)). The bread will follow the conveyor belt, until arriving at a seat of a diner. It is possible that the bread gets stuck in an infinite loop. Your task is to simulate the process, and output the final position of the bread, or determine that there will be an infinite loop. ""C x y c"" means that the type of the conveyor belt at (x,_) is changed to c. Queries are performed separately meaning that even if the bread got stuck in an infinite loop, it won't affect further queries."," The first line of input contains three integers n, m and q (1_____105,1_____10,1_____105), separated by a space.

The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops. The i i -th vertex also has an integer k i k written on itself. A travel on this graph works as follows.

If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round. Pay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500. If the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000·(1-40/250)=1680 points for this problem.

Manao is the chief architect involved in planning a new supercollider. He has to identify a plot of land where the largest possible supercollider can be built. The supercollider he is building requires four-way orthogonal collisions of particles traveling at the same speed, so it will consist of four accelerating chambers and be shaped like a plus sign (i.e., +). Each of the four accelerating chambers must be the same length and must be aligned with the Earth's magnetic field (parallel or orthogonal) to minimize interference. The accelerating chambers need to be laid down across long flat stretches of land to keep costs under control. Thus, Manao has already commissioned a topographical study that has identified all possible maximal length tracts of land available for building accelerating chambers that are either parallel or orthogonal to the Earth's magnetic field. To build the largest possible supercollider, Manao must identify the largest symmetric plus shape from among these candidate tracts. That is, he must find the two tracts of land that form an axis-aligned plus shape with the largest distance from the center of the plus to the tip of the shortest of the four arms of the plus.

1272,"Emuskald was hired to design an artificial waterfall according to the latest trends in landscape architecture. A modern artificial waterfall consists of multiple horizontal panels affixed to a wide flat wall. The water flows down the top of the wall from panel to panel until it reaches the bottom of the wall. The wall has height t and has n panels on the wall. Each panel is a horizontal segment at height hi which begins at li and ends at ri. The i-th panel connects the points (li,_i) and (ri,_i) of the plane. The top of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points (-109,_) and (109,_). Similarly, the bottom of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points (-109,0) and (109,0). No two panels share a common point. Emuskald knows that for the waterfall to be aesthetically pleasing, it can flow from panel i to panel j () only if the following conditions hold: max(li,_j)<_in(ri,_j) (horizontal projections of the panels overlap); hj<_i (panel j is below panel i); there is no such panel k (hj<_k<_i) that the first two conditions hold for the pairs (i,_) and (k,_). Then the flow for is equal to min(ri,_j)-_ax(li,_j), the length of their horizontal projection overlap. Emuskald has decided that in his waterfall the water will flow in a single path from top to bottom. If water flows to a panel (except the bottom of the wall), the water will fall further to exactly one lower panel. The total amount of water flow in the waterfall is then defined as the minimum horizontal projection overlap between two consecutive panels in the path of the waterfall. Formally: the waterfall consists of a single path of panels ; the flow of the waterfall is the minimum flow in the path . To make a truly great waterfall Emuskald must maximize this water flow, but there are too many panels and he is having a hard time planning his creation.

All priorities are distinct. It turns out, that if you set a tree on fire, it will burn to nothing. However, this process doesn't happen instantly. At the beginning, burns out the leaf (a vertex is called to be a leaf if it has only one adjacent vertex) of the tree of the minimum priority. Then burns out the leaf of the minimal priority of the remaining tree, and so on. This way, the vertices turn into the leaves and burn out until only one vertex remains. Then this vertex burns out as well. Lena has prepared a tree of n n vertices and every vertex in it has a priority p v =v p . Lena is very curious about burning out this tree. However, she understands, that if she will burn the tree now, then it will disappear completely. Lena is a kind girl and she will feel bad for the burned tree, so she wants to study the process of burning the tree only in her mind.

You have been tasked with optimizing the production of a certain type of tree for an especially large and important order. The tree in question is a rooted tree with n n vertices labelled with distinct integers from 0 0 to n1 n . The vertex labelled 0 0 is the root of the tree, and for any non-root vertex v v the label of its parent p(v) p is less than the label of v v . All trees at the factory are made from bamboo blanks.

To process a bamboo into another tree a single type of operation can be made: choose an arbitrary non-root vertex v v such that its parent p(v) p is not a root either. The operation consists of changing the parent of v v to its parent's parent p(p(v)) p . Note that parents of all other vertices remain unchanged, in particular, the subtree of v v does not change. Efficiency is crucial, hence you have to minimize the number of operations to make the desired tree from a bamboo blank. Construct any optimal sequence of operations to produce the desired tree. Note that the labelling of the resulting tree has to coincide with the labelling of the desired tree. Formally, the labels of the roots have to be equal, and for non-root vertices with the same label the labels of their parents should be the same. It is guaranteed that for any test present in this problem an answer exists, and further, an optimal sequence contains at most 10 6 10 operations. Note that any hack that does not meet these conditions will be invalid."," The first line contains a single integer n n   the number of vertices in the tree ( 2_ 10 5 2 ).

1964,"In this problem you will have to deal with a real algorithm that is used in the VK social network. As in any other company that creates high-loaded websites, the VK developers have to deal with request statistics regularly. An important indicator reflecting the load of the site is the mean number of requests for a certain period of time of T seconds (for example, T=60 seconds=1 min and T=86400 seconds=1 day). For example, if this value drops dramatically, that shows that the site has access problem. If this value grows, that may be a reason to analyze the cause for the growth and add more servers to the website if it is really needed. However, even such a natural problem as counting the mean number of queries for some period of time can be a challenge when you process the amount of data of a huge social network. That's why the developers have to use original techniques to solve problems approximately, but more effectively at the same time. Let's consider the following formal model. We have a service that works for n seconds. We know the number of queries to this resource at at each moment of time t (1______). Let's formulate the following algorithm of calculating the mean with exponential decay. Let c be some real number, strictly larger than one.  // setting this constant value correctly can adjust    // the time range for which statistics will be calculated double c = some constant value;   // as the result of the algorithm's performance this variable will contain  // the mean number of queries for the last  // T seconds by the current moment of time double mean = 0.0;   for t = 1..n: // at each second, we do the following:     // at is the number of queries that came at the last second;     mean = (mean + at / T) / c; Thus, the mean variable is recalculated each second using the number of queries that came at that second. We can make some mathematical calculations and prove that choosing the value of constant c correctly will make the value of mean not very different from the real mean value ax at t-_+1______. The advantage of such approach is that it only uses the number of requests at the current moment of time and doesn't require storing the history of requests for a large time range. Also, it considers the recent values with the weight larger than the weight of the old ones, which helps to react to dramatic change in values quicker. However before using the new theoretical approach in industrial programming, there is an obligatory step to make, that is, to test its credibility practically on given test data sets. Your task is to compare the data obtained as a result of the work of an approximate algorithm to the real data. You are given n values at, integer T and real number c. Also, you are given m moments pj (1______), where we are interested in the mean value of the number of queries for the last T seconds. Implement two algorithms. The first one should calculate the required value by definition, i.e. by the formula . The second algorithm should calculate the mean value as is described above.

For this reason, each concert will be performed by a different set of dancers. A dancer may perform in multiple concerts. For example, it is possible that a set of dancers performs in one concert and a subset of this set of dancers performs in another concert. The only constraint is that the same set of dancers cannot perform twice. The director prefers the set with larger number of dancers over the set with smaller number of dancers. If two sets consist of the same number of dancers, then the director prefers the one which has smaller sum of awkwardness of dancers.

1306,"In the rush of modern life, people often forget how beautiful the world is. The time to enjoy those around them is so little that some even stand in queues to several rooms at the same time in the clinic, running from one queue to another. (Cultural note: standing in huge and disorganized queues for hours is a native tradition in Russia, dating back to the Soviet period. Queues can resemble crowds rather than lines. Not to get lost in such a queue, a person should follow a strict survival technique: you approach the queue and ask who the last person is, somebody answers and you join the crowd. Now you're the last person in the queue till somebody else shows up. You keep an eye on the one who was last before you as he is your only chance to get to your destination) I'm sure many people have had the problem when a stranger asks who the last person in the queue is and even dares to hint that he will be the last in the queue and then bolts away to some unknown destination. These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series. Such people often create problems in queues, because the newcomer does not see the last person in the queue and takes a place after the ""virtual"" link in this chain, wondering where this legendary figure has left. The Smart Beaver has been ill and he's made an appointment with a therapist. The doctor told the Beaver the sad news in a nutshell: it is necessary to do an electrocardiogram. The next day the Smart Beaver got up early, put on the famous TV series on download (three hours till the download's complete), clenched his teeth and bravely went to join a queue to the electrocardiogram room, which is notorious for the biggest queues at the clinic. Having stood for about three hours in the queue, the Smart Beaver realized that many beavers had not seen who was supposed to stand in the queue before them and there was a huge mess. He came up to each beaver in the ECG room queue and asked who should be in front of him in the queue. If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...

2658,"Recently in school Alina has learned what are the persistent data structures: they are data structures that always preserves the previous version of itself and access to it when it is modified. After reaching home Alina decided to invent her own persistent data structure. Inventing didn't take long: there is a bookcase right behind her bed. Alina thinks that the bookcase is a good choice for a persistent data structure. Initially the bookcase is empty, thus there is no book at any position at any shelf. The bookcase consists of n shelves, and each shelf has exactly m positions for books at it. Alina enumerates shelves by integers from 1 to n and positions at shelves   from 1 to m. Initially the bookcase is empty, thus there is no book at any position at any shelf in it. Alina wrote down q operations, which will be consecutively applied to the bookcase. Each of the operations has one of four types: 1 i j   Place a book at position j at shelf i if there is no book at it. 2 i j   Remove the book from position j at shelf i if there is a book at it. 3 i   Invert book placing at shelf i. This means that from every position at shelf i which has a book at it, the book should be removed, and at every position at shelf i which has not book at it, a book should be placed. 4 k   Return the books in the bookcase in a state they were after applying k-th operation. In particular, k=0 means that the bookcase should be in initial state, thus every book in the bookcase should be removed from its position.

There are n bus stops located along the street, the i-th of them is located at the distance ai from the central square, all distances are distinct, the stops are numbered in the order of increasing distance from the square, that is, ai<_i+1 for all i from 1 to n-1. The bus starts its journey from the first stop, it passes stops 2, 3 and so on. It reaches the stop number n, turns around and goes in the opposite direction to stop 1, passing all the intermediate stops in the reverse order. After that, it again starts to move towards stop n. During the day, the bus runs non-stop on this route. The bus is equipped with the Berland local positioning system. When the bus passes a stop, the system notes down its number. One of the key features of the system is that it can respond to the queries about the distance covered by the bus for the parts of its path between some pair of stops. A special module of the system takes the input with the information about a set of stops on a segment of the path, a stop number occurs in the set as many times as the bus drove past it. This module returns the length of the traveled segment of the path (or -1 if it is impossible to determine the length uniquely). The operation of the module is complicated by the fact that stop numbers occur in the request not in the order they were visited but in the non-decreasing order. For example, if the number of stops is 6, and the part of the bus path starts at the bus stop number 5, ends at the stop number 3 and passes the stops as follows: , then the request about this segment of the path will have form: 3,4,5,5,6.

Igor's chessboard is a square of size n___ cells. Igor decided that simple rules guarantee success, that's why his game will have only one type of pieces. Besides, all pieces in his game are of the same color. The possible moves of a piece are described by a set of shift vectors. The next passage contains a formal description of available moves. Let the rows of the board be numbered from top to bottom and the columns be numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Let's assign to each square a pair of integers (x,_)  the number of the corresponding column and row.

1252,"There is a programming language in which every program is a non-empty sequence of ""<"" and "">"" signs and digits. Let's explain how the interpreter of this programming language works. A program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer (IP) which consists of two parts. Current character pointer (CP); Direction pointer (DP) which can point left or right; Initially CP points to the leftmost character of the sequence and DP points to the right. We repeat the following steps until the first moment that CP points to somewhere outside the sequence. If CP is pointing to a digit the interpreter prints that digit then CP moves one step according to the direction of DP. After that the value of the printed digit in the sequence decreases by one. If the printed digit was 0 then it cannot be decreased therefore it's erased from the sequence and the length of the sequence decreases by one. If CP is pointing to ""<"" or "">"" then the direction of DP changes to ""left"" or ""right"" correspondingly. Then CP moves one step according to DP. If the new character that CP is pointing to is ""<"" or "">"" then the previous character will be erased from the sequence. If at any moment the CP goes outside of the sequence the execution is terminated. It's obvious the every program in this language terminates after some steps. We have a sequence s1,_2,...,_n of ""<"", "">"" and digits. You should answer q queries.

There are books written about my adventures and songs about my operations, though you were able to catch me up in a pretty awkward moment. I was able to hide from cameras, outsmart all the guards and pass numerous traps, but when I finally reached the treasure box and opened it, I have accidentally started the clockwork bomb! Luckily, I have met such kind of bombs before and I know that the clockwork mechanism can be stopped by connecting contacts with wires on the control panel of the bomb in a certain manner. I see n contacts connected by n-1 wires. Contacts are numbered with integers from 1 to n. Bomb has a security mechanism that ensures the following condition: if there exist k__2 contacts c1,_2,...,_k forming a circuit, i. e. there exist k distinct wires between contacts c1 and c2, c2 and c3, ..., ck and c1, then the bomb immediately explodes and my story ends here. In particular, if two contacts are connected by more than one wire they form a circuit of length 2. It is also prohibited to connect a contact with itself. On the other hand, if I disconnect more than one wire (i. e. at some moment there will be no more than n-2 wires in the scheme) then the other security check fails and the bomb also explodes. So, the only thing I can do is to unplug some wire and plug it into a new place ensuring the fact that no circuits appear. I know how I should put the wires in order to stop the clockwork.

Residents of Tomsk while away the time sitting in warm apartments, inventing a lot of different games. One of such games is 'Colored Jenga'. This game requires wooden blocks of three colors: red, green and blue. A tower of n levels is made from them. Each level consists of three wooden blocks. The blocks in each level can be of arbitrary colors, but they are always located close and parallel to each other. An example of such a tower is shown in the figure. The game is played by exactly one person. Every minute a player throws a special dice which has six sides. Two sides of the dice are green, two are blue, one is red and one is black. The dice shows each side equiprobably. If the dice shows red, green or blue, the player must take any block of this color out of the tower at this minute so that the tower doesn't fall. If this is not possible, the player waits until the end of the minute, without touching the tower. He also has to wait until the end of the minute without touching the tower if the dice shows the black side. It is not allowed to take blocks from the top level of the tower (whether it is completed or not). Once a player got a block out, he must put it on the top of the tower so as to form a new level or finish the upper level consisting of previously placed blocks. The newly constructed levels should have all the same properties as the initial levels. If the upper level is not completed, starting the new level is prohibited. For the tower not to fall, in each of the levels except for the top, there should be at least one block. Moreover, if at some of these levels there is exactly one block left and this block is not the middle block, the tower falls.

The first character of the slogan must be in the first square (the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second square, and so on. Of course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on the poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the k-th square of the poster.

Then, the integer x x is inadequate only if the last digit of x x is strictly less than the reminder of division of k k by 11 11 . Here _/10  denotes x/10 x rounded down.

1140,"The coronation of King Berl XXII is soon! The whole royal family, including n n daughters of Berl XXII, will be present. The King has ordered his jeweler to assemble n n beautiful necklaces, so each of the princesses could wear exactly one necklace during the ceremony  and now these necklaces are finished. Each necklace consists of m m gems attached to a gold chain. There are two types of gems used in the necklaces  emeralds and sapphires. So, each necklace can be represented by a sequence of m m gems (listed from left to right), and each gem is either an emerald or a sapphire. Formally, the i i -th necklace can be represented by a binary string s i s of length m m ; if the j j -th character of s i s is 0, then the j j -th gem in the i i -th necklace is an emerald; otherwise, this gem is a sapphire. Now, looking at the necklaces, the King is afraid that some of his daughters may envy the other daughters' necklaces. He wants all necklaces to look similar. Two necklaces are considered similar if there are at least k k positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems. For example, if there is a necklace represented by a sequence 01010111 and a necklace represented by a sequence 01100000, then there are 3 3 positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems (both first gems are emeralds, both second gems are sapphires, and both fifth gems are emeralds). So if k=3 k , these necklaces are similar, and if k=4 k , they are not similar. The King thinks that if two of his daughters notice that their necklaces are not similar, then they may have a conflict  and, obviously, he doesn't want any conflicts during the coronation! So Berl XXII wants to tell some of his daughters to wear their necklaces backward. If a necklace is worn backward, then the sequence of gems in this necklace is reversed. For example, if a necklace is represented by a sequence 01100, then, if worn backward, it would be represented by a sequence 00110. The King wants to find the minimum number of necklaces to be worn backward during the coronation so that there are no conflicts.

56,"Natasha is going to fly to Mars. She needs to build a rocket, which consists of several stages in some order. Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string  concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages. There are n n stages available. The rocket must contain exactly k k of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'. For the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'  26 26 tons. Build the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.
