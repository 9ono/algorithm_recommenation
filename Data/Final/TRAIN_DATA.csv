310,"Polycarp is an introvert person. In fact he is so much of an introvert that he plays ""Monsters and Potions"" board game alone. The board of the game is a row of n n cells. The cells are numbered from 1 1 to n n from left to right. There are three types of cells: a cell containing a single monster, a cell containing a single potion or a blank cell (it contains neither a monster nor a potion). Polycarp has m m tokens representing heroes fighting monsters, which are initially located in the blank cells s 1 , s 2 ,, s m s . Polycarp's task is to choose a single cell (rally point) and one by one move all the heroes into this cell. A rally point can be a cell of any of three types. After Policarp selects a rally point, he picks a hero and orders him to move directly to the point. Once that hero reaches the point, Polycarp picks another hero and orders him also to go to the point. And so forth, until all the heroes reach the rally point cell. While going to the point, a hero can not deviate from the direct route or take a step back. A hero just moves cell by cell in the direction of the point until he reaches it. It is possible that multiple heroes are simultaneously in the same cell. Initially the i i -th hero has h i h hit points (HP). Monsters also have HP, different monsters might have different HP. And potions also have HP, different potions might have different HP. If a hero steps into a cell which is blank (i.e. doesn't contain a monster/potion), hero's HP does not change. If a hero steps into a cell containing a monster, then the hero and the monster fight. If monster's HP is strictly higher than hero's HP, then the monster wins and Polycarp loses the whole game. If hero's HP is greater or equal to monster's HP, then the hero wins and monster's HP is subtracted from hero's HP. I.e. the hero survives if his HP drops to zero, but dies (and Polycarp looses) if his HP becomes negative due to a fight. If a hero wins a fight with a monster, then the monster disappears, and the cell becomes blank. If a hero steps into a cell containing a potion, then the hero drinks the potion immediately. As a result, potion's HP is added to hero's HP, the potion disappears, and the cell becomes blank. Obviously, Polycarp wants to win the game. It means that he must choose such rally point and the order in which heroes move, that every hero reaches the rally point and survives. I.e. Polycarp loses if a hero reaches rally point but is killed by a monster at the same time.

Even under a microscope, bacteria of those two species are very difficult to distinguish. In fact, the only thing the scientists possess that is able to differentiate between them is a plant called Formurosa. If the scientists place a sample of colonies of bacteria on each on Formurosa's leaves, it will activate a complicated nutrition process. During that process color of Formurosa changes to reflect the result of a  possibly very complicated  logical formula on the species of bacteria, involving constants and the operators | (OR), & (AND) and ^ (XOR). If it is 0, the plant will turn red, otherwise  it will turn blue. For example, if the nutrition process of Formurosa is described by the formula: (((?^?)|?)&(1^?)); then Formurosa has four leaves (the ""?"" signs denote the leaves).

1211,"This problem is about imaginary languages BHTML and BCSS, which slightly resemble HTML and CSS. Read the problem statement carefully as the resemblance is rather slight and the problem uses very simplified analogs. You are given a BHTML document that resembles HTML but is much simpler. It is recorded as a sequence of opening and closing tags. A tag that looks like ""<tagname>"" is called an opening tag and a tag that looks like ""</tagname>"" is called a closing tag. Besides, there are self-closing tags that are written as ""<tagname/>"" and in this problem they are fully equivalent to ""<tagname></tagname>"". All tagnames in this problem are strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length from 1 to 10 characters. Tagnames of different tags may coincide. The document tags form a correct bracket sequence, that is, we can obtain an empty sequence from the given one using the following operations: remove any self-closing tag ""<tagname/>"", remove a pair of an opening and a closing tag that go consecutively (in this order) and have the same names. In other words, remove substring ""<tagname></tagname>"". For example, you may be given such document: ""<header><p><a/><b></b></p></header><footer></footer>"" but you may not be given documents ""<a>"", ""<a></b>"", ""</a><a>"" or ""<a><b></a></b>"". Obviously, for any opening tag there is the only matching closing one  each such pair is called an element. A self-closing tag also is an element. Let's consider that one element is nested inside another one, if tags of the first element are between tags of the second one. An element is not nested to itself. For instance, in the example above element ""b"" is nested in ""header"" and in ""p"", but it isn't nested in ""a"" and ""footer"", also it isn't nested to itself (""b""). Element ""header"" has three elements nested in it, and ""footer"" has zero. We need the BCSS rules to apply styles when displaying elements of the BHTML documents. Each rule is recorded as a subsequence of words ""x1 x2 ... xn"". This rule has effect over all such elements t, which satisfy both conditions from the list: there is a sequence of nested elements with tagnames ""x1"", ""x2"", ..., ""xn"" (that is, the second element is nested in the first one, the third element is nested in the second one and so on), this sequence ends with element t (i.e. tagname of element t equals ""xn""). For example, element ""b"" meets the conditions of the rule ""a b"" if for element ""b"" exists element ""a"" in which it is nested. Element ""c"" meets the conditions of the rule ""a b b c"", if three elements exist: ""a"", ""b"", ""b"", and in the chain ""a""-""b""-""b""-""c"" each following element is nested in the previous one.

The shells are left on so there is no way to distinguish a raw egg from a cooked egg. One at a time, a player will select an egg, and then smash the egg on his/her forehead. If the egg was cooked, not much happens, but if the egg was raw, it will make quite the mess.

These data centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that client data is really big!). Main feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers. For each of m company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as ci,1 and ci,2. In order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly.

Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed.

Manao has developed a model to predict the stock price of a company over the next n days and wants to design a profit-maximizing trading algorithm to make use of these predictions. Unfortunately, Manao's trading account has the following restrictions: It only allows owning either zero or one shares of stock at a time; It only allows buying or selling a share of this stock once per day; It allows a maximum of k buy orders over the next n days; For the purposes of this problem, we define a trade to a be the act of buying one share of stock on day i, then holding the stock until some day j>_ at which point the share is sold. To restate the above constraints, Manao is permitted to make at most k non-overlapping trades during the course of an n-day trading period for which Manao's model has predictions about the stock price.

For example, using this model, Manao could wait until the price is low, then buy one share and hold until the price reaches a high value, then sell for a profit, and repeat this process up to k times until n days have passed. Nevertheless, Manao is not satisfied by having a merely good trading algorithm, and wants to develop an optimal strategy for trading subject to these constraints.

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump. For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs.

Due to the wind, when a tree is cut down, it either falls left with probability p, or falls right with probability 1-_.

Unfortunately, she already killed all the snakes, so there are only ladders left now. The game is played on a 10_10 10 board as follows: At the beginning of the game, the player is at the bottom left square. The objective of the game is for the player to reach the Goal (the top left square) by following the path and climbing vertical ladders. Once the player reaches the Goal, the game ends. The path is as follows: if a square is not the end of its row, it leads to the square next to it along the direction of its row; if a square is the end of its row, it leads to the square above it. The direction of a row is determined as follows: the direction of the bottom row is to the right; the direction of any other row is opposite the direction of the row below it. See Notes section for visualization of path. During each turn, the player rolls a standard six-sided dice. Suppose that the number shown on the dice is r r . If the Goal is less than r r squares away on the path, the player doesn't move (but the turn is performed). Otherwise, the player advances exactly r r squares along the path and then stops. If the player stops on a square with the bottom of a ladder, the player chooses whether or not to climb up that ladder. If she chooses not to climb, then she stays in that square for the beginning of the next turn. Some squares have a ladder in them. Ladders are only placed vertically  each one leads to the same square of some of the upper rows. In order for the player to climb up a ladder, after rolling the dice, she must stop at the square containing the bottom of the ladder. After using the ladder, the player will end up in the square containing the top of the ladder. She cannot leave the ladder in the middle of climbing. And if the square containing the top of the ladder also contains the bottom of another ladder, she is not allowed to use that second ladder. The numbers on the faces of the dice are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with each number having the same probability of being shown. Please note that: it is possible for ladders to overlap, but the player cannot switch to the other ladder while in the middle of climbing the first one; it is possible for ladders to go straight to the top row, but not any higher; it is possible for two ladders to lead to the same tile; it is possible for a ladder to lead to a tile that also has a ladder, but the player will not be able to use that second ladder if she uses the first one; the player can only climb up ladders, not climb down.

There are n barriers in total, and i-th of them occupied the cells li through ri of the row ui. Andryusha recollects well that no two barriers share the same row. Furthermore, no row is completely occupied with a barrier, that is, at least one cell in each row is free. The player can throw a marble to any column of the machine from above. A marble falls downwards until it encounters a barrier, or falls through the bottom of the board. A marble disappears once it encounters a barrier but is replaced by two more marbles immediately to the left and to the right of the same barrier. In a situation when the barrier is at an edge of the board, both marbles appear next to the barrier at the side opposite to the edge.

The dot product of two integer number vectors x and y of size n is the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the vectors.

305,"Berkomnadzor  Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media  is a Berland federal executive body that protects ordinary residents of Berland from the threats of modern internet. Berkomnadzor maintains a list of prohibited IPv4 subnets (blacklist) and a list of allowed IPv4 subnets (whitelist). All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Berland must configure the network equipment to block access to all IPv4 addresses matching the blacklist. Also ISPs must provide access (that is, do not block) to all IPv4 addresses matching the whitelist. If an IPv4 address does not match either of those lists, it's up to the ISP to decide whether to block it or not. An IPv4 address matches the blacklist (whitelist) if and only if it matches some subnet from the blacklist (whitelist). An IPv4 address can belong to a whitelist and to a blacklist at the same time, this situation leads to a contradiction (see no solution case in the output description). An IPv4 address is a 32-bit unsigned integer written in the form a.b.c.d a , where each of the values a,b,c,d a is called an octet and is an integer from 0 0 to 255 255 written in decimal notation. For example, IPv4 address 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.1 can be converted to a 32-bit number using the following expression 192 2 24 +168 2 16 +0 2 8 +1 2 0 192 . First octet a a encodes the most significant (leftmost) 8 8 bits, the octets b b and c c   the following blocks of 8 8 bits (in this order), and the octet d d encodes the least significant (rightmost) 8 8 bits. The IPv4 network in Berland is slightly different from the rest of the world. There are no reserved or internal addresses in Berland and use all 2 32 2 possible values. An IPv4 subnet is represented either as a.b.c.d a or as a.b.c.d/x a (where 0_32 0 ). A subnet a.b.c.d a contains a single address a.b.c.d a . A subnet a.b.c.d/x a contains all IPv4 addresses with x x leftmost (most significant) bits equal to x x leftmost bits of the address a.b.c.d a . It is required that 32_ 32 rightmost (least significant) bits of subnet a.b.c.d/x a are zeroes. Naturally it happens that all addresses matching subnet a.b.c.d/x a form a continuous range. The range starts with address a.b.c.d a (its rightmost 32_ 32 bits are zeroes). The range ends with address which x x leftmost bits equal to x x leftmost bits of address a.b.c.d a , and its 32_ 32 rightmost bits are all ones. Subnet contains exactly 2 32_ 2 addresses. Subnet a.b.c.d/32 a contains exactly one address and can also be represented by just a.b.c.d a . For example subnet 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.0.0 contains range of 256 addresses. 192.168.0.0 192.168.0.0 is the first address of the range, and 192.168.0.255 192.168.0.255 is the last one. Berkomnadzor's engineers have devised a plan to improve performance of Berland's global network. Instead of maintaining both whitelist and blacklist they want to build only a single optimised blacklist containing minimal number of subnets. The idea is to block all IPv4 addresses matching the optimised blacklist and allow all the rest addresses. Of course, IPv4 addresses from the old blacklist must remain blocked and all IPv4 addresses from the old whitelist must still be allowed. Those IPv4 addresses which matched neither the old blacklist nor the old whitelist may be either blocked or allowed regardless of their accessibility before. Please write a program which takes blacklist and whitelist as input and produces optimised blacklist. The optimised blacklist must contain the minimal possible number of subnets and satisfy all IPv4 addresses accessibility requirements mentioned above. IPv4 subnets in the source lists may intersect arbitrarily. Please output a single number -1 if some IPv4 address matches both source whitelist and blacklist."," The first line of the input contains single integer n n ( 1_2 10 5 1 )  total number of IPv4 subnets in the input. The following n n lines contain IPv4 subnets. Each line starts with either '-' or '+' sign, which indicates if the subnet belongs to the blacklist or to the whitelist correspondingly. It is followed, without any spaces, by the IPv4 subnet in a.b.c.d a or a.b.c.d/x a format ( 0_32 0 ). The blacklist always contains at least one subnet.

However, best friends are important too. John is Chris' best friend. Once walking with his friend, John gave Chris the following problem: At the infinite horizontal road of width w, bounded by lines y=0 and y=_, there is a bus moving, presented as a convex polygon of n vertices. The bus moves continuously with a constant speed of v in a straight Ox line in direction of decreasing x coordinates, thus in time only x coordinates of its points are changing.

There is a pedestrian in the point (0,0), who can move only by a vertical pedestrian crossing, presented as a segment connecting points (0,0) and (0,_) with any speed not exceeding u. Thus the pedestrian can move only in a straight line Oy in any direction with any speed not exceeding u and not leaving the road borders. The pedestrian can instantly change his speed, thus, for example, he can stop instantly. Please look at the sample note picture for better understanding.

Polycarpus wants to save these pictures on his laptop, but the problem is, laptops do not allow to write hieroglyphs circles.

2859,"This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java   call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal   flush(output). Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind. On a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed. Then the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are ""bulls"", if on different positions, they are ""cows"". Thus a response is a pair of numbers   the number of ""bulls"" and the number of ""cows"". A try can contain equal digits. More formally, let's the secret string is s and the second player are trying to guess it with a string x. The number of ""bulls"" is a number of such positions i (1_____4) where s[i]=_[i]. The number of ""cows"" is a number of such digits c that s contains c in the position i (i.e. s[i]=_), x contains c, but x[i]___. For example, the secret string is ""0427"", the opponent's try is ""0724"", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are ""0"" and ""2"", the cows are ""4"" and ""7""). If the secret string is ""0123"", the opponent's try is ""0330"", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow. In this problem you are to guess the string s that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits. You can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals ""4 0"", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate. That is possible for two reasons   the program either guessed the number x or made an invalid action (for example, printed letters instead of digits).

You can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit string containing distinct digits   the secret string."," To read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input.

In order to prevent this from happening to future Doctors, Heidi decided to prepare herself by learning some basic hashing techniques. The first hashing function she designed is as follows. Given two positive integers (x,y) ( she defines H(x,y):= x 2 +2xy+x+1 H . Now, Heidi wonders if the function is reversible. That is, given a positive integer r r , can you find a pair (x,y) ( (of positive integers) such that H(x,y)=r H ? If multiple such pairs exist, output the one with smallest possible x x . If there is no such pair, output ""NO"".", The first and only line contains an integer r r ( 1_ 10 12 1 ).,"Output integers x,y x such that H(x,y)=r H and x x is smallest possible, or ""NO"" if no such pair exists.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

And now almost every city in Berland has a Bulmart store, and some cities even have several of them! The only problem is, at the moment sales are ... let's say a little below estimates. Some people even say that shovels retail market is too small for such a big company to make a profit. But the company management believes in the future of that market and seeks new ways to increase income. There are n cities in Berland connected with m bi-directional roads. All roads have equal lengths. It can happen that it is impossible to reach a city from another city using only roads. There is no road which connects a city to itself.

The latest idea of the Bulmart management is to create a program which will help customers get shovels as fast as possible for affordable budget. Formally, the program has to find the minimum amount of time needed to deliver rj shovels to the customer in the city gj for the total cost of no more than aj burles. The delivery time between any two adjacent cities is equal to 1. If shovels are delivered from several cities, the delivery time is equal to the arrival time of the last package.

Polycarp draws snakes with lowercase Latin letters. He always draws the first snake with the symbol 'a', the second snake with the symbol 'b', the third snake with the symbol 'c' and so on.

Every day the country's best shooters master their skills there and the many visitors compete in clay pigeon shooting to win decent prizes. And the head of the park has recently decided to make an online version of the shooting gallery. During the elaboration process it turned out that the program that imitates the process of shooting effectively, is needed. To formulate the requirements to the program, the shooting gallery was formally described. A 3D Cartesian system of coordinates was introduced, where the X axis ran across the gallery floor along the line, along which the shooters are located, the Y axis ran vertically along the gallery wall and the positive direction of the Z axis matched the shooting direction. Let's call the XOY plane a shooting plane and let's assume that all the bullets are out of the muzzles at the points of this area and fly parallel to the Z axis. Every clay pigeon can be represented as a rectangle whose sides are parallel to X and Y axes, and it has a positive z-coordinate. The distance between a clay pigeon and the shooting plane is always different for every target. The bullet hits the target if it goes through the inner area or border of the rectangle corresponding to it. When the bullet hits the target, the target falls down vertically into the crawl-space of the shooting gallery and cannot be shot at any more. The targets are tough enough, that's why a bullet can not pierce a target all the way through and if a bullet hits a target it can't fly on.

These children use well-defined protocols for playing with the toys: Each child has a lovely set of toys that he loves to play with. He requests the toys one after another at distinct moments of time. A child starts playing if and only if he is granted all the toys in his lovely set. If a child starts playing, then sooner or later he gives the toys back. No child keeps the toys forever. Children request toys at distinct moments of time. No two children request a toy at the same time. If a child is granted a toy, he never gives it back until he finishes playing with his lovely set. If a child is not granted a toy, he waits until he is granted this toy. He can't request another toy while waiting. If two children are waiting for the same toy, then the child who requested it first will take the toy first. Children don't like to play with each other. That's why they never share toys. When a child requests a toy, then granting the toy to this child depends on whether the toy is free or not. If the toy is free, Sagheer will give it to the child. Otherwise, the child has to wait for it and can't request another toy. Children are smart and can detect if they have to wait forever before they get the toys they want. In such case they start crying. In other words, a crying set is a set of children in which each child is waiting for a toy that is kept by another child in the set.

There was something unusual about the garland. Each lamp had its own brightness which depended on the temperature of the lamp. Temperatures could be positive, negative or zero.

It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So n is a number such that n+1 is a power of 2. In the picture you can see a complete binary tree with n=15. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric. You have to write a program that for given n answers q queries to the tree. Each query consists of an integer number ui (1___i___) and a string si, where ui is the number of vertex, and si represents the path starting from this vertex. String si doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from si have to be processed from left to right, considering that ui is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by si ends. For example, if ui=4 and si=__URL», then the answer is 10."," The first line contains two integer numbers n and q (1_____1018, q__1). n is such that n+1 is a power of 2.

We will use (r,_) to denote a cell located in the row r and column c. Gosha is often invited somewhere. Every time he gets an invitation, he first calculates the number of ways to get to this place, and only then he goes. Gosha's house is located in the cell (1,1). At any moment of time, Gosha moves from the cell he is currently located in to a cell adjacent to it (two cells are adjacent if they share a common side). Of course, the movement is possible only if such a cell exists, i.e. Gosha will not go beyond the boundaries of the table. Thus, from the cell (r,_) he is able to make a move to one of the cells (r-1,_), (r,_-1), (r+1,_), (r,_+1). Also, Ghosha can skip a move and stay in the current cell (r,_). Besides the love of strange calculations, Gosha is allergic to cats, so he never goes to the cell that has a cat in it. Gosha knows exactly where and when he will be invited and the schedule of cats travelling along the table.

Two ways to go from cell (1,1) to cell (x,_) at time t are considered distinct if for at least one moment of time from 1 to t Gosha's positions are distinct for the two ways at this moment.

Sometimes (or quite often) there are teachers who do not like you. Incidentally Noora also has one such teacher. His name is Yury Dmitrievich and he teaches graph theory. Yury Dmitrievich doesn't like Noora, so he always gives the girl the most difficult tasks. So it happened this time. The teacher gives Noora a tree with n vertices. Vertices are numbered with integers from 1 to n. The length of all the edges of this tree is 1. Noora chooses a set of simple paths that pairwise don't intersect in edges. However each vertex should belong to at least one of the selected path. For each of the selected paths, the following is done: We choose exactly one edge (u,_) that belongs to the path. On the selected edge (u,_) there is a point at some selected distance x from the vertex u and at distance 1-_ from vertex v. But the distance x chosen by Noora arbitrarily, i. e. it can be different for different edges. One of the vertices u or v is selected. The point will start moving to the selected vertex. Let us explain how the point moves by example. Suppose that the path consists of two edges (v1,_2) and (v2,_3), the point initially stands on the edge (v1,_2) and begins its movement to the vertex v1. Then the point will reach v1, then ""turn around"", because the end of the path was reached, further it will move in another direction to vertex v2, then to vertex v3, then ""turn around"" again, then move to v2 and so on. The speed of the points is 1 edge per second. For example, for 0.5 second the point moves to the length of the half of an edge. A stopwatch is placed at each vertex of the tree. The time that the stopwatches indicate at start time is 0 seconds. Then at the starting moment of time, all points simultaneously start moving from the selected positions to selected directions along the selected paths, and stopwatches are simultaneously started. When one of the points reaches the vertex v, the stopwatch at the vertex v is automatically reset, i.e. it starts counting the time from zero. Denote by resv the maximal time that the stopwatch at the vertex v will show if the point movement continues infinitely. Noora is asked to select paths and points on them so that res1 is as minimal as possible. If there are several solutions to do this, it is necessary to minimize res2, then res3, res4,...,_esn.

There are n hills arranged on a line, each in the form of a vertical line segment with one endpoint on the ground. The hills are numbered with numbers from 1 to n from left to right. The i-th hill stands at position xi with its top at height yi. For every two hills a and b, if the top of hill a can be seen from the top of hill b, their tops are connected by a rope.

The first and the second climbers of the i-th team are located at the top of the ai-th and bi-th hills, respectively. They want to meet together at the top of some hill. Now, each of two climbers move according to the following process: if a climber is at the top of the hill where the other climber is already located or will come eventually, the former climber stays at this hill; otherwise, the climber picks a hill to the right of his current hill that is reachable by a rope and is the rightmost possible, climbs this hill and continues the process (the climber can also climb a hill whose top is lower than the top of his current hill).

This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java   call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal   flush(output). Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind. On a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed. Then the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are ""bulls"", if on different positions, they are ""cows"". Thus a response is a pair of numbers   the number of ""bulls"" and the number of ""cows"". A try can contain equal digits. More formally, let's the secret string is s and the second player are trying to guess it with a string x. The number of ""bulls"" is a number of such positions i (1_____4) where s[i]=_[i]. The number of ""cows"" is a number of such digits c that s contains c in the position i (i.e. s[i]=_), x contains c, but x[i]___. For example, the secret string is ""0427"", the opponent's try is ""0724"", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are ""0"" and ""2"", the cows are ""4"" and ""7""). If the secret string is ""0123"", the opponent's try is ""0330"", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow. In this problem you are to guess the string s that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits. You can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals ""4 0"", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate.

Every task i has an integer number ai associated with it denoting how many man-hours are required to complete the i-th task. Developers are not self-confident at all, and they are actually afraid of difficult tasks.

After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games. Kuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity. The paper is divided into n n pieces enumerated from 1 1 to n n . Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the i i -th piece has color c i c where c i =0 c defines black color, c i =1 c defines white color and c i =1 c means that the piece hasn't been colored yet. The rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ( 0 0 or 1 1 ) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, [1010] [ , [0101] [ , [1] [ , [0] [ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece x x to piece y y if and only if there is an arrow from x x to y y .

By a lucky coincidence, the old rivals made it to the finals: company R1 and company R2. The finals will have n questions, m of them are auction questions and n-_ of them are regular questions. Each question has a price. The price of the i-th question is ai points. During the game the players chose the questions. At that, if the question is an auction, then the player who chose it can change the price if the number of his current points is strictly larger than the price of the question. The new price of the question cannot be less than the original price and cannot be greater than the current number of points of the player who chose the question. The correct answer brings the player the points equal to the price of the question. The wrong answer to the question reduces the number of the player's points by the value of the question price.

The process of curfew enforcement is the following. One instructor starts near room 1 and moves toward room n, while the second instructor starts near room n and moves toward room 1. After processing current room, each instructor moves on to the next one. Both instructors enter rooms and move simultaneously, if n is odd, then only the first instructor processes the middle room. When all rooms are processed, the process ends. When an instructor processes a room, she counts the number of students in the room, then turns off the light, and locks the room. Also, if the number of students inside the processed room is not equal to b, the instructor writes down the number of this room into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room). Instructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day), so they don't care about who is in the room, but only about the number of students. While instructors are inside the rooms, students can run between rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can run by at most d rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that differs my at most d. Also, after (or instead of) running each student can hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor will not count her during the processing. In each room any number of students can hide simultaneously. Formally, here is what's happening: A curfew is announced, at this point in room i there are ai students. Each student can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her initial room, or stay in place. After that each student can optionally hide under a bed. Instructors enter room 1 and room n, they count students there and lock the room (after it no one can enter or leave this room). Each student from rooms with numbers from 2 to n-1 can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her current room, or stay in place. Each student can optionally hide under a bed. Instructors move from room 1 to room 2 and from room n to room n-1. This process continues until all rooms are processed. Let x1 denote the number of rooms in which the first instructor counted the number of non-hidden students different from b, and x2 be the same number for the second instructor. Students know that the principal will only listen to one complaint, therefore they want to minimize the maximum of numbers xi.

She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence a0,_1,...,_h, where h is the height of the tree, and ai equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of i edges from root. Unfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence ai, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree. Two rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal.

As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of n brains and m brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together.

In other words, the suffix of the length x of string p is reversed and moved to the beginning of the string. For example, after the operation «shift 4» the string «abcacb» will be changed with string «bcacab », since α=_b, β=_acb, βR=_cac.

She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position. Sonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet.

So the City has electricity if it has a power station in it or it is connected to a City which has electricity by a direct connection or via a chain of connections. Building a power station in City i i will cost c i c yen; Making a connection between City i i and City j j will cost k i + k j k yen per km of wire used for the connection.

Artem doesn't want to handle any exceptions, so he assumes that every time remove operation is called, that integer is presented in the multiset. Count the number of instances of the given integer that are stored in the multiset. But what about time machine?

First Artem adds integer 5 to the multiset at the 1-st moment of time. Then Artem adds integer 3 to the multiset at the moment 5. Then Artem asks how many 5 are there in the multiset at moment 6. The answer is 1. Then Artem returns back in time and asks how many integers 3 are there in the set at moment 4. Since 3 was added only at moment 5, the number of integers 3 at moment 4 equals to 0.

Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized. Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum. The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to ""true up"".

Each square has saturation (ai for the i-th square), which is measured by an integer from 0 to k. When the bar for some i (1______) is displayed, squares 1,2,... ,_-1 has the saturation k, squares i+1,_+2,... ,_ has the saturation 0, and the saturation of the square i can have any value from 0 to k. So some first squares of the progress bar always have the saturation k. Some last squares always have the saturation 0. And there is no more than one square that has the saturation different from 0 and k. The degree of the process's completion is measured in percents. Let the process be t% completed. Then the following inequation is fulfilled: An example of such a bar can be seen on the picture.

33,"In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system. There are n n officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer a a is the direct superior of officer b b , then we also can say that officer b b is a direct subordinate of officer a a . Officer x x is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer y y if one of the following conditions holds: officer y y is the direct superior of officer x x ; the direct superior of officer x x is a subordinate of officer y y . For example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer 3 3 are: 5,6,7,8,9 5 . The structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army. Formally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of n n vertices, in which vertex u u corresponds to officer u u . The parent of vertex u u corresponds to the direct superior of officer u u . The root (which has index 1 1 ) corresponds to the commander of the army. Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on q q queries, the i i -th query is given as ( u i , k i ) ( , where u i u is some officer, and k i k is a positive integer. To process the i i -th query imagine how a command from u i u spreads to the subordinates of u i u . Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here. Suppose the current officer is a a and he spreads a command. Officer a a chooses b b  one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then a a chooses the one having minimal index. Officer a a gives a command to officer b b . Afterwards, b b uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After b b finishes spreading the command, officer a a chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer a a cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer a a finishes spreading the command. Let's look at the following example: If officer 1 1 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [1,2,3,5,6,8,7,9,4] [ . If officer 3 3 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [3,5,6,8,7,9] [ . If officer 7 7 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [7,9] [ . If officer 9 9 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [9] [ .

The total weight of all boxes on the platform cannot exceed the strength of platform S at any time. The strength of any box of the platform at any time must be no less than the total weight of the boxes that stand above. You can take only the topmost box from the platform. The system receives n parcels, the i-th parcel arrives exactly at time ini, its weight and strength are equal to wi and si, respectively. Each parcel has a value of vi bourles. However, to obtain this value, the system needs to give the parcel exactly at time outi, otherwise Jaroslav will get 0 bourles for it.

This means that it is possible to make several operations of receiving and delivering parcels at the same time and in any order. Please note that the parcel that is delivered at time outi, immediately gets outside of the system, and the following activities taking place at the same time are made without taking it into consideration.

Measuring time is a complex process related to usage of a special sensor and a time counter. Think of the front wheel of a bicycle as a circle of radius r. Let's neglect the thickness of a tire, the size of the sensor, and all physical effects. The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a circle of radius r. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle.

Vitaly is in the first room of the house with n room located in a line and numbered starting from one from left to right. You can go from the first room to the second room, from the second room to the third room and so on  you can go from the (n-1)-th room to the n-th room. Thus, you can go to room x only from room x-1. The potato pie is located in the n-th room and Vitaly needs to go there. Each pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room x from room x-1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. In total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type t can open the door of type T if and only if t and T are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F. Each of the first n-1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he will immediately run into the next room. In other words, each key can open no more than one door. Vitaly realizes that he may end up in some room without the key that opens the door to the next room.

Then they applied a sequence of no more than n n (possibly zero) operations. i i -th operation is denoted by two integers a i a and b i b ( 1 a i , b i _ 1 ), and means swapping two elements of the string with indices a i a and b i b . All operations were done in the order they were placed in the sequence.

There are n dominoes on a 2D Cartesian plane. i-th domino (1______) can be represented as a line segment which is parallel to the y-axis and whose length is li. The lower point of the domino is on the x-axis. Let's denote the x-coordinate of the i-th domino as pi. Dominoes are placed one after another, so p1<_2<...<_n-1<_n holds. User ainta wants to take a video of falling dominoes. To make dominoes fall, he can push a single domino to the right. Then, the domino will fall down drawing a circle-shaped orbit until the line segment totally overlaps with the x-axis. Also, if the s-th domino touches the t-th domino while falling down, the t-th domino will also fall down towards the right, following the same procedure above. Domino s touches domino t if and only if the segment representing s and t intersects. See the picture above. If he pushes the leftmost domino to the right, it falls down, touching dominoes (A), (B) and (C). As a result, dominoes (A), (B), (C) will also fall towards the right. However, domino (D) won't be affected by pushing the leftmost domino, but eventually it will fall because it is touched by domino (C) for the first time. The picture above is an example of falling dominoes. Each red circle denotes a touch of two dominoes. User ainta has q plans of posting the video. j-th of them starts with pushing the xj-th domino, and lasts until the yj-th domino falls. But sometimes, it could be impossible to achieve such plan, so he has to lengthen some dominoes. It costs one dollar to increase the length of a single domino by 1. User ainta wants to know, for each plan, the minimum cost needed to achieve it. Plans are processed independently, i. e. if domino's length is increased in some plan, it doesn't affect its length in other plans. Set of dominos that will fall except xj-th domino and yj-th domino doesn't matter, but the initial push should be on domino xj."," The first line contains an integer n (2_____2__105)  the number of dominoes.

1158,"Pathfinding is a task of finding a route between two points. It often appears in many problems. For example, in a GPS navigation software where a driver can query for a suggested route, or in a robot motion planning where it should find a valid sequence of movements to do some tasks, or in a simple maze solver where it should find a valid path from one point to another point. This problem is related to solving a maze. The maze considered in this problem is in the form of a matrix of integers A A of N_N N . The value of each cell is generated from a given array R R and C C of N N integers each. Specifically, the value on the i th i row and j th j column, cell (i,j) ( , is equal to R i + C j R . Note that all indexes in this problem are from 1 1 to N N . A path in this maze is defined as a sequence of cells ( r 1 , c 1 ),( r 2 , c 2 ),,( r k , c k ) ( such that | r i  r i+1 |+| c i  c i+1 |=1 | for all 1_<k 1 . In other words, each adjacent cell differs only by 1 1 row or only by 1 1 column. An even path in this maze is defined as a path in which all the cells in the path contain only even numbers. Given a tuple  r a , c a , r b , c b   as a query, your task is to determine whether there exists an even path from cell ( r a , c a ) ( to cell ( r b , c b ) ( . To simplify the problem, it is guaranteed that both cell ( r a , c a ) ( and cell ( r b , c b ) ( contain even numbers. For example, let N=5 N , R={6,2,7,8,3} R , and C={3,4,8,5,1} C .

She also noticed that the Doctor was in the k k -th universe. The tool also points out that due to restrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of universes will never exceed m m . Obviously, the multiverse is unstable because of free will. Each time a decision is made, one of two events will randomly happen: a new parallel universe is created, or a non-existent link is broken. More specifically, When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist.

To make the lives of citizens of Berland more varied, it was decided to change the calendar. As more and more people are complaining that ""the years fly by..."", it was decided that starting from the next year the number of days per year will begin to grow. So the coming year will have exactly a days, the next after coming year will have a+1 days, the next one will have a+2 days and so on. This schedule is planned for the coming n years (in the n-th year the length of the year will be equal a+_-1 day). No one has yet decided what will become of months. An MP Palevny made the following proposal. The calendar for each month is comfortable to be printed on a square sheet of paper. We are proposed to make the number of days in each month be the square of some integer. The number of days per month should be the same for each month of any year, but may be different for different years. The number of days in each year must be divisible by the number of days per month in this year. This rule ensures that the number of months in each year is an integer. The number of days per month for each year must be chosen so as to save the maximum amount of paper to print the calendars. In other words, the number of days per month should be as much as possible. These rules provide an unambiguous method for choosing the number of days in each month for any given year length. For example, according to Palevny's proposition, a year that consists of 108 days will have three months, 36 days each. The year that consists of 99 days will have 11 months, 9 days each, and a year of 365 days will have 365 months, one day each. The proposal provoked heated discussion in the community, the famous mathematician Perelmanov quickly calculated that if the proposal is supported, then in a period of n years, beginning with the year that has a days, the country will spend p sheets of paper to print a set of calendars for these years. Perelmanov's calculations take into account the fact that the set will contain one calendar for each year and each month will be printed on a separate sheet.

For example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as ""u"", and can be written as ""oo"". For this reason, two words ""ulyana"" and ""oolyana"" denote the same name. The second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both ""h"" and ""kh"" to write it. For example, the words ""mihail"" and ""mikhail"" denote the same name.

Suppose that exactly n girls participate in the competition initially. All the participants are divided into equal groups, x participants in each group. Furthermore the number x is chosen arbitrarily, i. e. on every stage number x can be different. Within each group the jury of the contest compares beauty of the girls in the format ""each with each"". In this way, if group consists of x girls, then comparisons occur. Then, from each group, the most beautiful participant is selected. Selected girls enter the next stage of the competition.

386,"International Coding Procedures Company (ICPC) writes all its code in Jedi Script (JS) programming language. JS does not get compiled, but is delivered for execution in its source form. Sources contain comments, extra whitespace (including trailing and leading spaces), and other non-essential features that make them quite large but do not contribute to the semantics of the code, so the process of minification is performed on source files before their delivery to execution to compress sources while preserving their semantics. You are hired by ICPC to write JS minifier for ICPC. Fortunately, ICPC adheres to very strict programming practices and their JS sources are quite restricted in grammar. They work only on integer algorithms and do not use floating point numbers and strings. Every JS source contains a sequence of lines. Each line contains zero or more tokens that can be separated by spaces. On each line, a part of the line that starts with a hash character ('#' code 35), including the hash character itself, is treated as a comment and is ignored up to the end of the line. Each line is parsed into a sequence of tokens from left to right by repeatedly skipping spaces and finding the longest possible token starting at the current parsing position, thus transforming the source code into a sequence of tokens. All the possible tokens are listed below: A reserved token is any kind of operator, separator, literal, reserved word, or a name of a library function that should be preserved during the minification process. Reserved tokens are fixed strings of non-space ASCII characters that do not contain the hash character ('#' code 35). All reserved tokens are given as an input to the minification process. A number token consists of a sequence of digits, where a digit is a character from zero ('0') to nine ('9') inclusive. A word token consists of a sequence of characters from the following set: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, underscore ('_' code 95), and dollar sign ('$' code 36). A word does not start with a digit. Note, that during parsing the longest sequence of characters that satisfies either a number or a word definition, but that appears in the list of reserved tokens, is considered to be a reserved token instead. During the minification process words are renamed in a systematic fashion using the following algorithm: Take a list of words that consist only of lowercase letters ordered first by their length, then lexicographically: ""a"", ""b"", ..., ""z"", ""aa"", ""ab"", ..., excluding reserved tokens, since they are not considered to be words. This is the target word list.

At first, there are n n moved out platforms on heights p 1 , p 2 ,, p n p . The platform on height h h is moved out (and the character is initially standing there). If you character is standing on some moved out platform on height x x , then he can pull a special lever, which switches the state of two platforms: on height x x and x1 x .

The bus system in the capital of Berland is arranged in such a way that each bus runs along the route between two stops. Each bus has no intermediate stops.

About each trip the stop where he started the trip and the the stop where he finished are known. The trips follow in the chronological order in Polycarp's notes. It is known that one trip on any bus costs a burles. In case when passenger makes a transshipment the cost of trip decreases to b burles (b<_). A passenger makes a transshipment if the stop on which he boards the bus coincides with the stop where he left the previous bus. Obviously, the first trip can not be made with transshipment.

His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression. Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions. Polycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a1,_2,...,_n, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8,6,4,2,1,4,7,10,2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8,6,4,2), (1,4,7,10) and (2), which are written one after another. Unfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of ai may be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1. For a given sequence a=(a1,_2,...,_n), which consists of positive integers and values -1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values -1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values ai>0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.

The order book is a list of orders (offers) from people that want to buy or sell one unit of the stock, each order is described by direction (BUY or SELL) and price. At every moment of time, every SELL offer has higher price than every BUY offer. In this problem no two ever existed orders will have the same price. The lowest-price SELL order and the highest-price BUY order are called the best offers, marked with black frames on the picture below. The presented order book says that someone wants to sell the product at price 12 12 and it's the best SELL offer because the other two have higher prices. The best BUY offer has price 10 10 . There are two possible actions in this orderbook: Somebody adds a new order of some direction with some price. Somebody accepts the best possible SELL or BUY offer (makes a deal). It's impossible to accept not the best SELL or BUY offer (to make a deal at worse price). After someone accepts the offer, it is removed from the orderbook forever. It is allowed to add new BUY order only with prices less than the best SELL offer (if you want to buy stock for higher price, then instead of adding an order you should accept the best SELL offer).

Some of magic effects are able to affect several field cells at once, cells that are situated not farther than n cells away from the cell in which the effect was applied. The distance between cells is the minimum number of cell border crosses on a path from one cell to another. It is easy to see that the number of cells affected by a magic effect grows rapidly when n increases, so it can adversely affect the game performance.

The alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large version of a letter x is denoted by x'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but all large letters are before all small letters. For example, the following conditions hold: 2<3, 2'<3', 3'<2. A word x1,_2,...,_a is not lexicographically greater than y1,_2,...,_b if one of the two following conditions holds: a___ and x1=_1,...,_a=_a, i.e. the first word is the prefix of the second word; there is a position 1______in(a,_), such that x1=_1,...,_j-1=_j-1 and xj<_j, i.e. at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has.

2056,"The first algorithm for detecting a face on the image working in realtime was developed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001. A part of the algorithm is a procedure that computes Haar features. As part of this task, we consider a simplified model of this concept. Let's consider a rectangular image that is represented with a table of size n___. The table elements are integers that specify the brightness of each pixel in the image. A feature also is a rectangular table of size n___. Each cell of a feature is painted black or white. To calculate the value of the given feature at the given image, you must perform the following steps. First the table of the feature is put over the table of the image (without rotations or reflections), thus each pixel is entirely covered with either black or white cell. The value of a feature in the image is the value of W-_, where W is the total brightness of the pixels in the image, covered with white feature cells, and B is the total brightness of the pixels covered with black feature cells. Some examples of the most popular Haar features are given below. Your task is to determine the number of operations that are required to calculate the feature by using the so-called prefix rectangles. A prefix rectangle is any rectangle on the image, the upper left corner of which coincides with the upper left corner of the image. You have a variable value, whose value is initially zero. In one operation you can count the sum of pixel values at any prefix rectangle, multiply it by any integer and add to variable value. You are given a feature.

Petya conducted a thorough analysis of his program and found out that his function for finding maximum element in an array of n positive integers was too slow. Desperate, Petya decided to use a somewhat unexpected optimization using parameter k, so now his function contains the following code:  int fast_max(int n, int a[]) {      int ans = 0;     int offset = 0;     for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)         if (ans < a[i]) {             ans = a[i];             offset = 0;         } else {             offset = offset + 1;             if (offset == k)                 return ans;         }     return ans; } That way the function iteratively checks array elements, storing the intermediate maximum, and if after k consecutive iterations that maximum has not changed, it is returned as the answer.

Overall, the game has 25 types of cards (5 distinct colors and 5 distinct values). Borya is holding n cards.

The aim of the other players is to achieve the state when Borya knows the color and number value of each of his cards. For that, other players can give him hints. The hints can be of two types: color hints and value hints. A color hint goes like that: a player names some color and points at all the cards of this color. Similarly goes the value hint.

There are two types of relations: synonymy (i. e. the two words mean the same) and antonymy (i. e. the two words mean the opposite). From time to time he discovers a new relation between two words. He know that if two words have a relation between them, then each of them has relations with the words that has relations with the other. For example, if like means love and love is the opposite of hate, then like is also the opposite of hate. One more example: if love is the opposite of hate and hate is the opposite of like, then love means like, and so on. Sometimes Mahmoud discovers a wrong relation. A wrong relation is a relation that makes two words equal and opposite at the same time. For example if he knows that love means like and like is the opposite of hate, and then he figures out that hate means like, the last relation is absolutely wrong because it makes hate and like opposite and have the same meaning at the same time.

340,"Everyone knows that computers become faster and faster. Recently Berland scientists have built a machine that can move itself back in time! More specifically, it works as follows. It has an infinite grid and a robot which stands on one of the cells. Each cell of the grid can either be empty or contain 0 or 1. The machine also has a program which consists of instructions, which are being handled one by one. Each instruction is represented by exactly one symbol (letter or digit) and takes exactly one unit of time (say, second) to be performed, except the last type of operation (it's described below). Here they are: 0 or 1: the robot places this number into the cell he is currently at. If this cell wasn't empty before the operation, its previous number is replaced anyway. e: the robot erases the number into the cell he is at. l, r, u or d: the robot goes one cell to the left/right/up/down. s: the robot stays where he is for a unit of time. t: let x x be 0 0 , if the cell with the robot is empty, otherwise let x x be one more than the digit in this cell (that is, x=1 x if the digit in this cell is 0 0 , and x=2 x if the digit is 1 1 ). Then the machine travels x x seconds back in time. Note that this doesn't change the instructions order, but it changes the position of the robot and the numbers in the grid as they were x x units of time ago. You can consider this instruction to be equivalent to a Ctrl-Z pressed x x times. For example, let the board be completely empty, and the program be sr1t0. Let the robot initially be at (0,0) ( . [now is the moment 0 0 , the command is s]: we do nothing. [now is the moment 1 1 , the command is r]: we are now at (1,0) ( . [now is the moment 2 2 , the command is 1]: we are at (1,0) ( , and this cell contains 1 1 . [now is the moment 3 3 , the command is t]: we travel 1+1=2 1 moments back, that is, to the moment 1 1 . [now is the moment 1 1 , the command is 0]: we are again at (0,0) ( , and the board is clear again, but after we follow this instruction, this cell has 0 0 in it. We've just rewritten the history. The consequences of the third instruction have never happened. Now Berland scientists want to use their machine in practice. For example, they want to be able to add two integers. Assume that the initial state of the machine is as follows: One positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,1) ( , from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit. The other positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,0) ( , from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit. All the other cells are empty. The robot is at (0,0) ( . We consider this state to be always in the past; that is, if you manage to travel to any negative moment, the board was always as described above, and the robot was at (0,0) ( for eternity. You are asked to write a program after which The robot stands on a non-empty cell, If we read the number starting from the cell with the robot and moving to the right until the first empty cell, this will be a+b a in binary, from the highest bit to the lowest bit. Note that there are no restrictions on other cells. In particular, there may be a digit just to the left to the robot after all instructions.

Naturally, this city has nm n intersections. At any intersection of i i -th Eastern street and j j -th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings. When Dora passes through the intersection of the i i -th Eastern and j j -th Southern street she examines those two streets.

Analysts have found that during the holidays, major sporting events and other significant events users begin to enter the network more frequently, resulting in great load increase on the infrastructure. As part of this task, we assume that the social network is 4n processes running on the n servers. All servers are absolutely identical machines, each of which has a volume of RAM of 1 GB = 1024 MB (1). Each process takes 100 MB of RAM on the server. At the same time, the needs of maintaining the viability of the server takes about 100 more megabytes of RAM. Thus, each server may have up to 9 different processes of social network. Now each of the n servers is running exactly 4 processes.

However, the multiverse itself works in mysterious ways. Well, it works using probabilities, which to some people is mysterious. At each unit time, when a decision is made, one of the two events will happen randomly. Let's denote l l as the current length of the multiverse. With a probability of p create =1 l m p , a universe will be created. With a probability of p break = l m p , a non-existent link will be broken at some position. More specifically, When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. Each position occurs with a probability of 1 l+1 1 . When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes, each with a probability of 1 l1 1 . After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist. As earlier, the Doctor remains in the same universe. However, if at some point the multiverse breaks in such a way that the Doctor finds himself at the leftmost or rightmost end of it, the TARDIS stops functioning.

First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). There are t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all. In this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit n+1. If it is less than 5 than the n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the n+1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position n is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. At the end, all trailing zeroes are thrown away.

3605,"Vova has recently learned what a circulaton in a graph is. Recall the definition: let G=(V,E) G be a directed graph. A circulation f f is such a collection of non-negative real numbers f e f ( e_ e ), that for each vertex v_ v the following conservation condition holds:  e δ  (v) f e =  e δ + (v) f e ___(v)fe=__+(v)f where δ + (v) δ is the set of edges that end in the vertex v v , and δ  (v) δ is the set of edges that start in the vertex v v .

This time Miroslav laid out n n skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from 1 1 to n n in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number i i , it leads to turning k k closest skewers from each side of the skewer i i , that is, skewers number i_ i , i_+1 i , ..., i1 i , i+1 i , ..., i+k1 i , i+k i (if they exist). For example, let n=6 n and k=1 k . When Miroslav turns skewer number 3 3 , then skewers with numbers 2 2 , 3 3 , and 4 4 will come up turned over.

Let's consider an ordinary column with coordinate x.

In this task let's assume that this column supports the segment of the ceiling from point to point (here both fractions are considered as real division). If the length of the segment of the ceiling supported by the column exceeds di, then the column cannot support it and it crashes after a while, and after that the load is being redistributeed between the neighbouring columns according to the same principle. Thus, ordinary columns will be crashing for some time until the process stops at some state. One can prove that the set of the remaining columns doesn't depend on the order in which columns crash. If there are only two bearing columns left in the end, then we assume that the whole construction crashes under the weight of the roof.

2208,"A schoolboy named Vasya loves reading books on programming and mathematics. He has recently read an encyclopedia article that described the method of median smoothing (or median filter) and its many applications in science and engineering. Vasya liked the idea of the method very much, and he decided to try it in practice. Applying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence of numbers a1,_2,...,_n will result a new sequence b1,_2,...,_n obtained by the following algorithm: b1=_1, bn=_n, that is, the first and the last number of the new sequence match the corresponding numbers of the original sequence. For i=2,...,_-1 value bi is equal to the median of three values ai-1, ai and ai+1. The median of a set of three numbers is the number that goes on the second place, when these three numbers are written in the non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1. In order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only. Having made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to it. Now Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable.

Of course, this is a terrible situation, so Kevin Sun is planning to rectify it by constructing m undirected paths connecting pairs of distinct pastures. To make transportation more efficient, he also plans to pave some of these new paths. Kevin is very particular about certain aspects of path-paving. Since he loves odd numbers, he wants each pasture to have an odd number of paved paths connected to it. Thus we call a paving sunny if each pasture is incident to an odd number of paved paths. He also enjoys short paths more than long paths, so he would like the longest paved path to be as short as possible.

82,"Mrs. Smith is trying to contact her husband, John Smith, but she forgot the secret phone number! The only thing Mrs. Smith remembered was that any permutation of n n can be a secret phone number. Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband. The sequence of n n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 1 to n n exactly once. The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). A subsequence a i 1 , a i 2 ,, a i k a where 1 i 1 < i 2 << i k _ 1 is called increasing if a i 1 < a i 2 < a i 3 << a i k a . If a i 1 > a i 2 > a i 3 >> a i k a , a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences. For example, if there is a permutation [6,4,1,7,2,3,5] [ , LIS of this permutation will be [1,2,3,5] [ , so the length of LIS is equal to 4 4 . LDS can be [6,4,1] [ , [6,4,2] [ , or [6,4,3] [ , so the length of LDS is 3 3 . Note, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.

1161,"A forestation is an act of planting a bunch of trees to grow a forest, usually to replace a forest that had been cut down. Strangely enough, graph theorists have another idea on how to make a forest, i.e. by cutting down a tree! A tree is a graph of N N nodes connected by N1 N edges. Let u u be a node in a tree U U which degree is at least 2 2 (i.e. directly connected to at least 2 2 other nodes in U U ). If we remove u u from U U , then we will get two or more disconnected (smaller) trees, or also known as forest by graph theorists. In this problem, we are going to investigate a special forestation of a tree done by graph theorists. Let V(S) V be the set of nodes in a tree S S and V(T) V be the set of nodes in a tree T T . Tree S S and tree T T are identical if there exists a bijection f:V(S)_(T) f such that for all pairs of nodes ( s i , s j ) ( in V(S) V , s i s and s j s is connected by an edge in S S if and only if node f( s i ) f and f( s j ) f is connected by an edge in T T . Note that f(s)=t f implies node s s in S S corresponds to node t t in T T . We call a node u u in a tree U U as a good cutting point if and only if the removal of u u from U U causes two or more disconnected trees, and all those disconnected trees are pairwise identical. Given a tree U U , your task is to determine whether there exists a good cutting point in U U .

A laboratory unit is a plane with standard coordinate axes marked on it. Physicists from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology charged the axes by large electric charges: axis X is positive and axis Y is negative. Experienced laboratory worker marked n points with integer coordinates (xi,_i) on the plane and stopped the time. Sasha should use ""atomic tweezers"" to place elementary particles in these points. He has an unlimited number of electrons (negatively charged elementary particles) and protons (positively charged elementary particles). He can put either an electron or a proton at each marked point.

You can get from level i to levels i-1 and i+1, also you can get from level 1 to level n and vice versa. The map of the i-th level description size is ai bytes. In order to reduce the transmitted traffic, the game gets levels as follows. All the levels on the server are divided into m groups and each time a player finds himself on one of the levels of a certain group for the first time, the server sends all levels of the group to the game client as a single packet. Thus, when a player travels inside the levels of a single group, the application doesn't need any new information. Due to the technical limitations the packet can contain an arbitrary number of levels but their total size mustn't exceed b bytes, where b is some positive integer constant. Usual situation is that players finish levels one by one, that's why a decision was made to split n levels into m groups so that each group was a continuous segment containing multiple neighboring levels (also, the group can have two adjacent levels, n and 1). Specifically, if the descriptions of all levels have the total weight of at most b bytes, then they can all be united into one group to be sent in a single packet.

There is an extra constraint that the first character should not be a digit. There are four types of operations in the program, each denoted by one of the characters: $, ^, # or &. Each line of the program has one of the following formats: <lvalue>=<rvalue>, where <lvalue> and <rvalue> are valid variable names; <lvalue>=<arg1><op><arg2>, where <lvalue>, <arg1> and <arg2> are valid variable names, and <op> is an operation character. The program is executed line-by-line, and the result of execution is stored in a variable having the name res. If res is never assigned in the program, then the result will be equal to the value of res before running the program. Two programs are called equivalent if no matter which operations do characters $, ^, # and & denote (but, obviously, performing the same operation on the same arguments gives the same result) and which values do variables have before execution of program, the value of res after running the first program is equal to the value of res after running the second program (the programs are executed independently).

2078,"Let's define the permutation of length n as an array p=[p1,_2,...,_n] consisting of n distinct integers from range from 1 to n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on. Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p=[4,1,6,2,5,3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,1,6,2,5,3] is (421)(5)(63). Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,1,6,2,5,3] will become [4,2,1,5,6,3]. Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order.

Apart from the towers the kingdom has two armies, each headed by a tyrannical and narcissistic general. The generals can't stand each other, specifically, they will never let soldiers of two armies be present in one tower. During defence operations to manage a guard tower a general has to send part of his army to that tower. Each general asks some fee from the king for managing towers. As they live in a really far away kingdom, each general evaluates his fee in the following weird manner: he finds two remotest (the most distant) towers, where the soldiers of his army are situated and asks for the fee equal to the distance. Each tower is represented by a point on the plane with coordinates (x,_), and the distance between two points with coordinates (x1,_1) and (x2,_2) is determined in this kingdom as |x1-_2|+|y1-_2|. The greedy king was not exactly satisfied with such a requirement from the generals, that's why he only agreed to pay one fee for two generals, equal to the maximum of two demanded fees. However, the king is still green with greed, and among all the ways to arrange towers between armies, he wants to find the cheapest one. Each tower should be occupied by soldiers of exactly one army. He hired you for that. You should find the minimum amount of money that will be enough to pay the fees. And as the king is also very scrupulous, you should also count the number of arrangements that will cost the same amount of money.

2289,"After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer! Some days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his n students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation. Unfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked. Now the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers. Shapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include ""-"", "";"" and ""_"". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong.

At the same time, if the weight during rotation touches some of the other pegs, it then begins to rotate around that peg. Suppose that each peg itself is very thin and does not affect the rope length while weight is rotating around it. More formally, if at some moment the segment of the rope contains one or more pegs in addition to the peg around which the weight is rotating, the weight will then rotate around the farthermost one of them on a shorter segment of a rope.

As for the workouts, you all probably know that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the shooting range.

At each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction: either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will write an information to the cell). After receiving the command, the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case there is a deadlock: all these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever. Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core in the future will be able to record an information into the locked cell.

1483,"This problem consists of two subproblems: for solving subproblem D1 you will receive 3 points, and for solving subproblem D2 you will receive 16 points. Manao is the chief architect involved in planning a new supercollider. He has to identify a plot of land where the largest possible supercollider can be built. The supercollider he is building requires four-way orthogonal collisions of particles traveling at the same speed, so it will consist of four accelerating chambers and be shaped like a plus sign (i.e., +). Each of the four accelerating chambers must be the same length and must be aligned with the Earth's magnetic field (parallel or orthogonal) to minimize interference. The accelerating chambers need to be laid down across long flat stretches of land to keep costs under control. Thus, Manao has already commissioned a topographical study that has identified all possible maximal length tracts of land available for building accelerating chambers that are either parallel or orthogonal to the Earth's magnetic field. To build the largest possible supercollider, Manao must identify the largest symmetric plus shape from among these candidate tracts. That is, he must find the two tracts of land that form an axis-aligned plus shape with the largest distance from the center of the plus to the tip of the shortest of the four arms of the plus. Note that the collider need not use the entire length of the tracts identified (see the example in the notes)."," The first line of the input will contain two single-space-separated integers n, the number of north-south tracts and m, the number of west-east tracts.

The elevator shows each digit of a number with 7 light sticks by turning them on or off. The picture below shows how the elevator shows each digit. One day when Malek wanted to go from floor 88 to floor 0 using the elevator he noticed that the counter shows number 89 instead of 88. Then when the elevator started moving the number on the counter changed to 87. After a little thinking Malek came to the conclusion that there is only one explanation for this: One of the sticks of the counter was broken. Later that day Malek was thinking about the broken stick and suddenly he came up with the following problem. Suppose the digital counter is showing number n. Malek calls an integer x (0_____99) good if it's possible that the digital counter was supposed to show x but because of some(possibly none) broken sticks it's showing n instead. Malek wants to know number of good integers for a specific n. So you must write a program that calculates this number.

When heroes fight imps, they select a segment of the line, start at one end of the segment, and finish on the other end, without ever exiting the segment. They can move exactly one cell left or right from their current position and when they do so, they defeat one imp on the cell that they moved to, so, the number of imps on that cell decreases by one. This also applies when heroes appear at one end of the segment, at the beginning of their walk. Their goal is to defeat all imps on the segment, without ever moving to an empty cell in it (without imps), since they would get bored. Since Ignatius loves imps, he doesn_ really want to fight them, so no imps are harmed during the events of this task. However, he would like you to tell him whether it would be possible for him to clear a certain segment of imps in the above mentioned way if he wanted to. You are given q queries, which have two types: 1 a b k   denotes that k imps appear at each cell from the interval [a,_] 2 a b - asks whether Ignatius could defeat all imps on the interval [a,_] in the way described above"," The first line contains a single integer n (1_____200000), the length of the array a.

One of the most impressive features of «Lada Malina» is its highly efficient environment-friendly engines. Consider car as a point in Oxy plane. Car is equipped with k engines numbered from 1 to k. Each engine is defined by its velocity vector whose coordinates are (vxi,_yi) measured in distance units per day. An engine may be turned on at any level wi, that is a real number between -1 and +1 (inclusive) that result in a term of (wi·vxi,_i·vyi) in the final car velocity. Namely, the final car velocity is equal to (w1·vx1+_2·vx2+...+_k·vxk,  w1·vy1+_2·vy2+...+_k·vyk) Formally, if car moves with constant values of wi during the whole day then its x-coordinate will change by the first component of an expression above, and its y-coordinate will change by the second component of an expression above. For example, if all wi are equal to zero, the car won't move, and if all wi are equal to zero except w1=1, then car will move with the velocity of the first engine. There are n factories in Megapolia, i-th of them is located in (fxi,_yi). On the i-th factory there are ai cars «Lada Malina» that are ready for operation.

Of course, at the «AutoVoz» is going to bring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition. Cars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels, such that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition location.

The city officials decided to prepare for the Olympics thoroughly and to build all the necessary Olympic facilities as early as possible. First, a biathlon track will be built. To construct a biathlon track a plot of land was allocated, which is a rectangle divided into n___ identical squares. Each of the squares has two coordinates: the number of the row (from 1 to n), where it is located, the number of the column (from 1 to m), where it is located. Also each of the squares is characterized by its height. During the sports the biathletes will have to move from one square to another. If a biathlete moves from a higher square to a lower one, he makes a descent. If a biathlete moves from a lower square to a higher one, he makes an ascent. If a biathlete moves between two squares with the same height, then he moves on flat ground. The biathlon track should be a border of some rectangular area of the allocated land on which biathletes will move in the clockwise direction. It is known that on one move on flat ground an average biathlete spends tp seconds, an ascent takes tu seconds, a descent takes td seconds. The Tomsk Administration wants to choose the route so that the average biathlete passes it in as close to t seconds as possible.

1480,"You will receive 5 points for solving this problem. Manao has invented a new operation on strings that is called folding. Each fold happens between a pair of consecutive letters and places the second part of the string above first part, running in the opposite direction and aligned to the position of the fold. Using this operation, Manao converts the string into a structure that has one more level than there were fold operations performed. See the following examples for clarity. We will denote the positions of folds with '|' characters. For example, the word ""ABRACADABRA"" written as ""AB|RACA|DAB|RA"" indicates that it has been folded three times: first, between the leftmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters; second, between 'A' and 'D'; and third, between the rightmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters. Here are several examples of folded strings:  ""ABCDEF|GHIJK"" |  ""A|BCDEFGHIJK"" |  ""AB|RACA|DAB|RA"" |  ""X|XXXXX|X|X|XXXXXX""                |                 |                   |       XXXXXX     KJIHG      |   KJIHGFEDCB    |      AR           |       X    ABCDEF      |            A    |     DAB           |       X                |                 |     ACAR          |       XXXXX                |                 |       AB          |           X One last example for ""ABCD|EFGH|IJ|K"":   K IJ HGFE ABCD Manao noticed that each folded string can be viewed as several piles of letters. For instance, in the previous example, there are four piles, which can be read as ""AHI"", ""BGJK"", ""CF"", and ""DE"" from bottom to top. Manao wonders what is the highest pile of identical letters he can build using fold operations on a given word. Note that the pile should not contain gaps and should start at the bottom level. For example, in the rightmost of the four examples above, none of the piles would be considered valid since each of them has gaps, starts above the bottom level, or both.", The input will consist of one line containing a single string of n characters with 1_____1000 and no spaces.

748,"Toad Ilya has a rooted binary tree with vertex 1 1 being the root. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A tree is rooted if one vertex is selected and called the root. A vertex u u is a child of a vertex v v if u u and v v are connected by an edge and v v is closer to the root than u u . A leaf is a non-root vertex that has no children. In the tree Ilya has each vertex has at most two children, and each edge has some character written on it. The character can be a lowercase English letter or the question mark '?'. Ilya will q q times update the tree a bit. Each update will replace exactly one character on some edge. After each update Ilya needs to find if the tree is anagrammable and if yes, find its anagramnity for each letter. Well, that's difficult to explain, but we'll try. To start with, a string a a is an anagram of a string b b if it is possible to rearrange letters in a a (without changing the letters itself) so that it becomes b b . For example, the string ""fortyfive"" is an anagram of the string ""overfifty"", but the string ""aabb"" is not an anagram of the string ""bbba"". Consider a path from the root of the tree to a leaf. The characters on the edges on this path form a string, we say that this string is associated with this leaf. The tree is anagrammable if and only if it is possible to replace each question mark with a lowercase English letter so that for all pair of leaves the associated strings for these leaves are anagrams of each other. If the tree is anagrammable, then its anagramnity for the letter c c is the maximum possible number of letters c c in a string associated with some leaf in a valid replacement of all question marks. Please after each update find if the tree is anagrammable and if yes, find the _(c)_nd(c)  for all letters c c , where f(c) f is the anagramnity for the letter c c , and ind(x) i is the index of this letter in the alphabet ( ind( i ""a"" )=1 ) , ind( i ""b"" )=2 ) , ..., ind( i ""z"" )=26 ) )."," The first line of input contains two integers n n and q q ( 2_150000 2 , 1_150000 1 )  the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.

2882,"The gym leaders were fascinated by the evolutions which took place at Felicity camp. So, they were curious to know about the secret behind evolving Pokemon. The organizers of the camp gave the gym leaders a PokeBlock, a sequence of n ingredients. Each ingredient can be of type 0 or 1. Now the organizers told the gym leaders that to evolve a Pokemon of type k (k__2), they need to make a valid set of k cuts on the PokeBlock to get smaller blocks. Suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is b0b1b2... bn-1. You have a choice of making cuts at n+1 places, i.e., Before b0, between b0 and b1, between b1 and b2, ..., between bn-2 and bn-1, and after bn-1. The n+1 choices of making cuts are as follows (where a | denotes a possible cut): | b0 | b1 | b2 | ... | bn-2 | bn-1 | Consider a sequence of k cuts. Now each pair of consecutive cuts will contain a binary string between them, formed from the ingredient types. The ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are wasted, which is to say they are not considered. So there will be exactly k-1 such binary substrings. Every substring can be read as a binary number. Let m be the maximum number out of the obtained numbers. If all the obtained numbers are positive and the set of the obtained numbers contains all integers from 1 to m, then this set of cuts is said to be a valid set of cuts. For example, suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is 101101001110 and we made 5 cuts in the following way: 10 | 11 | 010 | 01 | 1 | 10 So the 4 binary substrings obtained are: 11, 010, 01 and 1, which correspond to the numbers 3, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. Here m=3, as it is the maximum value among the obtained numbers. And all the obtained numbers are positive and we have obtained all integers from 1 to m. Hence this set of cuts is a valid set of 5 cuts. A Pokemon of type k will evolve only if the PokeBlock is cut using a valid set of k cuts. There can be many valid sets of the same size. Two valid sets of k cuts are considered different if there is a cut in one set which is not there in the other set. Let f(k) denote the number of valid sets of k cuts. Find the value of .

It is guaranteed that r 1 + r 2 ++ r b =a+b1 r . The next a a lines contain coordinates of the Algoland cities  pairs of space-separated integers x a i ,y a i x ( 10000_ a i ,y a i 10000  ). The next b b lines contain coordinates of the Berland cities  pairs of space-separated integers x b i ,y b i x ( 10000_ b i ,y b i 10000  ). All cities are located at distinct points, no three of the a+b a cities lie on a single straight line. Sum of values a a across all test cases doesn't exceed 3000 3000 . Sum of values b b across all test cases doesn't exceed 3000 3000 .","For each of the t t test cases, first print ""YES"" if there is an answer or ""NO"" otherwise.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
3252,"Recently Luba bought a monitor. Monitor is a rectangular matrix of size n___. But then she started to notice that some pixels cease to work properly. Luba thinks that the monitor will become broken the first moment when it contains a square k___ consisting entirely of broken pixels. She knows that q pixels are already broken, and for each of them she knows the moment when it stopped working. Help Luba to determine when the monitor became broken (or tell that it's still not broken even after all q pixels stopped working)."," The first line contains four integer numbers n,_,_,_ (1___,___500,1______in(n,_),0______·m)   the length and width of the monitor, the size of a rectangle such that the monitor is broken if there is a broken rectangle with this size, and the number of broken pixels. Each of next q lines contain three integer numbers xi,_i,_i (1___i___,1___i___,0_____109)   coordinates of i-th broken pixel (its row and column in matrix) and the moment it stopped working.

686,"There is a robot staying at X=0 X on the Ox O axis. He has to walk to X=n X . You are controlling this robot and controlling how he goes. The robot has a battery and an accumulator with a solar panel. The i i -th segment of the path (from X=i1 X to X=i X ) can be exposed to sunlight or not. The array s s denotes which segments are exposed to sunlight: if segment i i is exposed, then s i =1 s , otherwise s i =0 s . The robot has one battery of capacity b b and one accumulator of capacity a a . For each segment, you should choose which type of energy storage robot will use to go to the next point (it can be either battery or accumulator). If the robot goes using the battery, the current charge of the battery is decreased by one (the robot can't use the battery if its charge is zero). And if the robot goes using the accumulator, the current charge of the accumulator is decreased by one (and the robot also can't use the accumulator if its charge is zero). If the current segment is exposed to sunlight and the robot goes through it using the battery, the charge of the accumulator increases by one (of course, its charge can't become higher than it's maximum capacity). If accumulator is used to pass some segment, its charge decreases by 1 no matter if the segment is exposed or not. You understand that it is not always possible to walk to X=n X . You want your robot to go as far as possible. Find the maximum number of segments of distance the robot can pass if you control him optimally."," The first line of the input contains three integers n,b,a n ( 1_,b,a2 10 5 1 )  the robot's destination point, the battery capacity and the accumulator capacity, respectively. The second line of the input contains n n integers s 1 , s 2 ,, s n s ( 0 s i 1 0 ), where s i s is 1 1 if the i i -th segment of distance is exposed to sunlight, and 0 0 otherwise.",Print one integer  the maximum number of segments the robot can pass if you control him optimally.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
