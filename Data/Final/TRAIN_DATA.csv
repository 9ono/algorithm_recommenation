310,"Polycarp is an introvert person. In fact he is so much of an introvert that he plays ""Monsters and Potions"" board game alone. The board of the game is a row of n n cells. The cells are numbered from 1 1 to n n from left to right. There are three types of cells: a cell containing a single monster, a cell containing a single potion or a blank cell (it contains neither a monster nor a potion). Polycarp has m m tokens representing heroes fighting monsters, which are initially located in the blank cells s 1 , s 2 ,, s m s . Polycarp's task is to choose a single cell (rally point) and one by one move all the heroes into this cell. A rally point can be a cell of any of three types. After Policarp selects a rally point, he picks a hero and orders him to move directly to the point. Once that hero reaches the point, Polycarp picks another hero and orders him also to go to the point. And so forth, until all the heroes reach the rally point cell. While going to the point, a hero can not deviate from the direct route or take a step back. A hero just moves cell by cell in the direction of the point until he reaches it. It is possible that multiple heroes are simultaneously in the same cell. Initially the i i -th hero has h i h hit points (HP). Monsters also have HP, different monsters might have different HP. And potions also have HP, different potions might have different HP. If a hero steps into a cell which is blank (i.e. doesn't contain a monster/potion), hero's HP does not change. If a hero steps into a cell containing a monster, then the hero and the monster fight. If monster's HP is strictly higher than hero's HP, then the monster wins and Polycarp loses the whole game. If hero's HP is greater or equal to monster's HP, then the hero wins and monster's HP is subtracted from hero's HP. I.e. the hero survives if his HP drops to zero, but dies (and Polycarp looses) if his HP becomes negative due to a fight. If a hero wins a fight with a monster, then the monster disappears, and the cell becomes blank. If a hero steps into a cell containing a potion, then the hero drinks the potion immediately. As a result, potion's HP is added to hero's HP, the potion disappears, and the cell becomes blank. Obviously, Polycarp wants to win the game. It means that he must choose such rally point and the order in which heroes move, that every hero reaches the rally point and survives. I.e. Polycarp loses if a hero reaches rally point but is killed by a monster at the same time.

Even under a microscope, bacteria of those two species are very difficult to distinguish. In fact, the only thing the scientists possess that is able to differentiate between them is a plant called Formurosa. If the scientists place a sample of colonies of bacteria on each on Formurosa's leaves, it will activate a complicated nutrition process. During that process color of Formurosa changes to reflect the result of a  possibly very complicated  logical formula on the species of bacteria, involving constants and the operators | (OR), & (AND) and ^ (XOR). If it is 0, the plant will turn red, otherwise  it will turn blue. For example, if the nutrition process of Formurosa is described by the formula: (((?^?)|?)&(1^?)); then Formurosa has four leaves (the ""?"" signs denote the leaves).

1211,"This problem is about imaginary languages BHTML and BCSS, which slightly resemble HTML and CSS. Read the problem statement carefully as the resemblance is rather slight and the problem uses very simplified analogs. You are given a BHTML document that resembles HTML but is much simpler. It is recorded as a sequence of opening and closing tags. A tag that looks like ""<tagname>"" is called an opening tag and a tag that looks like ""</tagname>"" is called a closing tag. Besides, there are self-closing tags that are written as ""<tagname/>"" and in this problem they are fully equivalent to ""<tagname></tagname>"". All tagnames in this problem are strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length from 1 to 10 characters. Tagnames of different tags may coincide. The document tags form a correct bracket sequence, that is, we can obtain an empty sequence from the given one using the following operations: remove any self-closing tag ""<tagname/>"", remove a pair of an opening and a closing tag that go consecutively (in this order) and have the same names. In other words, remove substring ""<tagname></tagname>"". For example, you may be given such document: ""<header><p><a/><b></b></p></header><footer></footer>"" but you may not be given documents ""<a>"", ""<a></b>"", ""</a><a>"" or ""<a><b></a></b>"". Obviously, for any opening tag there is the only matching closing one  each such pair is called an element. A self-closing tag also is an element. Let's consider that one element is nested inside another one, if tags of the first element are between tags of the second one. An element is not nested to itself. For instance, in the example above element ""b"" is nested in ""header"" and in ""p"", but it isn't nested in ""a"" and ""footer"", also it isn't nested to itself (""b""). Element ""header"" has three elements nested in it, and ""footer"" has zero. We need the BCSS rules to apply styles when displaying elements of the BHTML documents. Each rule is recorded as a subsequence of words ""x1 x2 ... xn"". This rule has effect over all such elements t, which satisfy both conditions from the list: there is a sequence of nested elements with tagnames ""x1"", ""x2"", ..., ""xn"" (that is, the second element is nested in the first one, the third element is nested in the second one and so on), this sequence ends with element t (i.e. tagname of element t equals ""xn""). For example, element ""b"" meets the conditions of the rule ""a b"" if for element ""b"" exists element ""a"" in which it is nested. Element ""c"" meets the conditions of the rule ""a b b c"", if three elements exist: ""a"", ""b"", ""b"", and in the chain ""a""-""b""-""b""-""c"" each following element is nested in the previous one.

The shells are left on so there is no way to distinguish a raw egg from a cooked egg. One at a time, a player will select an egg, and then smash the egg on his/her forehead.

These data centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that client data is really big!). Main feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers. For each of m company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as ci,1 and ci,2. In order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly.

Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed.

Manao has developed a model to predict the stock price of a company over the next n days and wants to design a profit-maximizing trading algorithm to make use of these predictions. Unfortunately, Manao's trading account has the following restrictions: It only allows owning either zero or one shares of stock at a time; It only allows buying or selling a share of this stock once per day; It allows a maximum of k buy orders over the next n days; For the purposes of this problem, we define a trade to a be the act of buying one share of stock on day i, then holding the stock until some day j>_ at which point the share is sold. To restate the above constraints, Manao is permitted to make at most k non-overlapping trades during the course of an n-day trading period for which Manao's model has predictions about the stock price.

For example, using this model, Manao could wait until the price is low, then buy one share and hold until the price reaches a high value, then sell for a profit, and repeat this process up to k times until n days have passed. Nevertheless, Manao is not satisfied by having a merely good trading algorithm, and wants to develop an optimal strategy for trading subject to these constraints.

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump. For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale ki products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2Â·ki products.

Due to the wind, when a tree is cut down, it either falls left with probability p, or falls right with probability 1-_.

She spent six months in that temple just playing ""Cat's Cradle"" so now she wants to try a different game  ""Snakes and Ladders"". Unfortunately, she already killed all the snakes, so there are only ladders left now. The game is played on a 10_10 10 board as follows: At the beginning of the game, the player is at the bottom left square. The objective of the game is for the player to reach the Goal (the top left square) by following the path and climbing vertical ladders. Once the player reaches the Goal, the game ends. The path is as follows: if a square is not the end of its row, it leads to the square next to it along the direction of its row; if a square is the end of its row, it leads to the square above it. The direction of a row is determined as follows: the direction of the bottom row is to the right; the direction of any other row is opposite the direction of the row below it. See Notes section for visualization of path. During each turn, the player rolls a standard six-sided dice. Suppose that the number shown on the dice is r r . If the Goal is less than r r squares away on the path, the player doesn't move (but the turn is performed). Otherwise, the player advances exactly r r squares along the path and then stops. If the player stops on a square with the bottom of a ladder, the player chooses whether or not to climb up that ladder. If she chooses not to climb, then she stays in that square for the beginning of the next turn. Some squares have a ladder in them. Ladders are only placed vertically  each one leads to the same square of some of the upper rows. In order for the player to climb up a ladder, after rolling the dice, she must stop at the square containing the bottom of the ladder. After using the ladder, the player will end up in the square containing the top of the ladder. She cannot leave the ladder in the middle of climbing. And if the square containing the top of the ladder also contains the bottom of another ladder, she is not allowed to use that second ladder. The numbers on the faces of the dice are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with each number having the same probability of being shown.

There are n barriers in total, and i-th of them occupied the cells li through ri of the row ui. Andryusha recollects well that no two barriers share the same row. Furthermore, no row is completely occupied with a barrier, that is, at least one cell in each row is free. The player can throw a marble to any column of the machine from above. A marble falls downwards until it encounters a barrier, or falls through the bottom of the board. A marble disappears once it encounters a barrier but is replaced by two more marbles immediately to the left and to the right of the same barrier. In a situation when the barrier is at an edge of the board, both marbles appear next to the barrier at the side opposite to the edge.

The dot product of two integer number vectors x and y of size n is the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the vectors.

305,"Berkomnadzor  Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media  is a Berland federal executive body that protects ordinary residents of Berland from the threats of modern internet. Berkomnadzor maintains a list of prohibited IPv4 subnets (blacklist) and a list of allowed IPv4 subnets (whitelist). All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Berland must configure the network equipment to block access to all IPv4 addresses matching the blacklist. Also ISPs must provide access (that is, do not block) to all IPv4 addresses matching the whitelist. If an IPv4 address does not match either of those lists, it's up to the ISP to decide whether to block it or not. An IPv4 address matches the blacklist (whitelist) if and only if it matches some subnet from the blacklist (whitelist). An IPv4 address can belong to a whitelist and to a blacklist at the same time, this situation leads to a contradiction (see no solution case in the output description). An IPv4 address is a 32-bit unsigned integer written in the form a.b.c.d a , where each of the values a,b,c,d a is called an octet and is an integer from 0 0 to 255 255 written in decimal notation. For example, IPv4 address 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.1 can be converted to a 32-bit number using the following expression 192 2 24 +168 2 16 +0 2 8 +1 2 0 192 . First octet a a encodes the most significant (leftmost) 8 8 bits, the octets b b and c c   the following blocks of 8 8 bits (in this order), and the octet d d encodes the least significant (rightmost) 8 8 bits. The IPv4 network in Berland is slightly different from the rest of the world. There are no reserved or internal addresses in Berland and use all 2 32 2 possible values. An IPv4 subnet is represented either as a.b.c.d a or as a.b.c.d/x a (where 0_32 0 ). A subnet a.b.c.d a contains a single address a.b.c.d a . A subnet a.b.c.d/x a contains all IPv4 addresses with x x leftmost (most significant) bits equal to x x leftmost bits of the address a.b.c.d a . It is required that 32_ 32 rightmost (least significant) bits of subnet a.b.c.d/x a are zeroes. Naturally it happens that all addresses matching subnet a.b.c.d/x a form a continuous range. The range starts with address a.b.c.d a (its rightmost 32_ 32 bits are zeroes). The range ends with address which x x leftmost bits equal to x x leftmost bits of address a.b.c.d a , and its 32_ 32 rightmost bits are all ones. Subnet contains exactly 2 32_ 2 addresses. Subnet a.b.c.d/32 a contains exactly one address and can also be represented by just a.b.c.d a . For example subnet 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.0.0 contains range of 256 addresses. 192.168.0.0 192.168.0.0 is the first address of the range, and 192.168.0.255 192.168.0.255 is the last one. Berkomnadzor's engineers have devised a plan to improve performance of Berland's global network. Instead of maintaining both whitelist and blacklist they want to build only a single optimised blacklist containing minimal number of subnets. The idea is to block all IPv4 addresses matching the optimised blacklist and allow all the rest addresses. Of course, IPv4 addresses from the old blacklist must remain blocked and all IPv4 addresses from the old whitelist must still be allowed. Those IPv4 addresses which matched neither the old blacklist nor the old whitelist may be either blocked or allowed regardless of their accessibility before. Please write a program which takes blacklist and whitelist as input and produces optimised blacklist. The optimised blacklist must contain the minimal possible number of subnets and satisfy all IPv4 addresses accessibility requirements mentioned above. IPv4 subnets in the source lists may intersect arbitrarily. Please output a single number -1 if some IPv4 address matches both source whitelist and blacklist."," The first line of the input contains single integer n n ( 1_2 10 5 1 )  total number of IPv4 subnets in the input. The following n n lines contain IPv4 subnets. Each line starts with either '-' or '+' sign, which indicates if the subnet belongs to the blacklist or to the whitelist correspondingly.

However, best friends are important too. John is Chris' best friend. Once walking with his friend, John gave Chris the following problem: At the infinite horizontal road of width w, bounded by lines y=0 and y=_, there is a bus moving, presented as a convex polygon of n vertices. The bus moves continuously with a constant speed of v in a straight Ox line in direction of decreasing x coordinates, thus in time only x coordinates of its points are changing. Formally, after time t each of x coordinates of its points will be decreased by vt. There is a pedestrian in the point (0,0), who can move only by a vertical pedestrian crossing, presented as a segment connecting points (0,0) and (0,_) with any speed not exceeding u. Thus the pedestrian can move only in a straight line Oy in any direction with any speed not exceeding u and not leaving the road borders. The pedestrian can instantly change his speed, thus, for example, he can stop instantly. Please look at the sample note picture for better understanding.

We know that no hieroglyph occurs twice in either the first or the second circle (but in can occur once in each of them). Polycarpus wants to save these pictures on his laptop, but the problem is, laptops do not allow to write hieroglyphs circles.

2859,"This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java   call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal   flush(output). Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind. On a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed. Then the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are ""bulls"", if on different positions, they are ""cows"". Thus a response is a pair of numbers   the number of ""bulls"" and the number of ""cows"". A try can contain equal digits. More formally, let's the secret string is s and the second player are trying to guess it with a string x. The number of ""bulls"" is a number of such positions i (1_____4) where s[i]=_[i]. The number of ""cows"" is a number of such digits c that s contains c in the position i (i.e. s[i]=_), x contains c, but x[i]___. For example, the secret string is ""0427"", the opponent's try is ""0724"", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are ""0"" and ""2"", the cows are ""4"" and ""7""). If the secret string is ""0123"", the opponent's try is ""0330"", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow. In this problem you are to guess the string s that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits. You can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals ""4 0"", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate. That is possible for two reasons   the program either guessed the number x or made an invalid action (for example, printed letters instead of digits).

You can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit string containing distinct digits   the secret string."," To read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input.

Heidi figured out that Madame Kovarian uses a very complicated hashing function in order to change the names of the babies she steals. In order to prevent this from happening to future Doctors, Heidi decided to prepare herself by learning some basic hashing techniques. The first hashing function she designed is as follows. Given two positive integers (x,y) ( she defines H(x,y):= x 2 +2xy+x+1 H . Now, Heidi wonders if the function is reversible. That is, given a positive integer r r , can you find a pair (x,y) ( (of positive integers) such that H(x,y)=r H ? If multiple such pairs exist, output the one with smallest possible x x .

And now almost every city in Berland has a Bulmart store, and some cities even have several of them! The only problem is, at the moment sales are ... let's say a little below estimates. Some people even say that shovels retail market is too small for such a big company to make a profit. But the company management believes in the future of that market and seeks new ways to increase income. There are n cities in Berland connected with m bi-directional roads.

Once the car reaches house ai, the passenger is immediately picked up and the driver starts driving to house bi. Once house bi is reached, the passenger gets dropped off and the car becomes available for new rides staying next to the house bi. It is allowed for multiple cars to be located next to the same house at the same point in time, while waiting for ride requests or just passing by. If there are no available cars at time ti when a request for taxi ride comes, then: The i-th passenger will have to wait for a car to become available. When a car becomes available, operator will immediately assign it to this taxi ride request. If multiple cars become available at once while the passenger is waiting, operator will pick a car out of them according to the rules described above. Operator processes taxi ride requests one by one. So if multiple passengers are waiting for the cars to become available, operator will not move on to processing the (i+1)-th ride request until the car gets assigned to the i-th ride request. Your task is to write a program that will process the given list of m taxi ride requests.

At that the Hat is believed to base its considerations on the student's personal qualities: it sends the brave and noble ones to Gryffindor, the smart and shrewd ones   to Ravenclaw, the persistent and honest ones   to Hufflepuff and the clever and cunning ones   to Slytherin. However, a first year student Hermione Granger got very concerned about the forthcoming sorting. She studied all the literature on the Sorting Hat and came to the conclusion that it is much simpler than that. If the relatives of the student have already studied at Hogwarts, the hat puts the student to the same house, where his family used to study. In controversial situations, when the relatives studied in different houses or when they were all Muggles like Hermione's parents, then the Hat sorts the student to the house, to which the least number of first years has been sent at that moment. If there are several such houses, the choice is given to the student himself. Then the student can choose any of the houses, to which the least number of first years has been sent so far. Hermione has already asked the students that are on the list before her about their relatives. Now she and her new friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley want to find out into what house the Hat will put Hermione."," The first input line contains an integer n (1_____10000).

Every day the country's best shooters master their skills there and the many visitors compete in clay pigeon shooting to win decent prizes. And the head of the park has recently decided to make an online version of the shooting gallery. During the elaboration process it turned out that the program that imitates the process of shooting effectively, is needed. To formulate the requirements to the program, the shooting gallery was formally described. A 3D Cartesian system of coordinates was introduced, where the X axis ran across the gallery floor along the line, along which the shooters are located, the Y axis ran vertically along the gallery wall and the positive direction of the Z axis matched the shooting direction. Let's call the XOY plane a shooting plane and let's assume that all the bullets are out of the muzzles at the points of this area and fly parallel to the Z axis. Every clay pigeon can be represented as a rectangle whose sides are parallel to X and Y axes, and it has a positive z-coordinate. The distance between a clay pigeon and the shooting plane is always different for every target. The bullet hits the target if it goes through the inner area or border of the rectangle corresponding to it. When the bullet hits the target, the target falls down vertically into the crawl-space of the shooting gallery and cannot be shot at any more. The targets are tough enough, that's why a bullet can not pierce a target all the way through and if a bullet hits a target it can't fly on.

These children use well-defined protocols for playing with the toys: Each child has a lovely set of toys that he loves to play with. He requests the toys one after another at distinct moments of time. A child starts playing if and only if he is granted all the toys in his lovely set. If a child starts playing, then sooner or later he gives the toys back. No child keeps the toys forever. Children request toys at distinct moments of time. No two children request a toy at the same time. If a child is granted a toy, he never gives it back until he finishes playing with his lovely set. If a child is not granted a toy, he waits until he is granted this toy. He can't request another toy while waiting. If two children are waiting for the same toy, then the child who requested it first will take the toy first. Children don't like to play with each other. That's why they never share toys. When a child requests a toy, then granting the toy to this child depends on whether the toy is free or not. If the toy is free, Sagheer will give it to the child. Otherwise, the child has to wait for it and can't request another toy. Children are smart and can detect if they have to wait forever before they get the toys they want.

Dima remembered that each two lamps in the garland were connected directly or indirectly via some wires. Furthermore, the number of wires was exactly one less than the number of lamps. There was something unusual about the garland. Each lamp had its own brightness which depended on the temperature of the lamp. Temperatures could be positive, negative or zero. Dima has two friends, so he decided to share the garland with them. He wants to cut two different wires so that the garland breaks up into three parts. Each part of the garland should shine equally, i. e. the sums of lamps' temperatures should be equal in each of the parts. Of course, each of the parts should be non-empty, i. e. each part should contain at least one lamp. Help Dima to find a suitable way to cut the garland, or determine that this is impossible.

3017,"T is a complete binary tree consisting of n vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So n is a number such that n+1 is a power of 2. In the picture you can see a complete binary tree with n=15. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric. You have to write a program that for given n answers q queries to the tree. Each query consists of an integer number ui (1___i___) and a string si, where ui is the number of vertex, and si represents the path starting from this vertex. String si doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from si have to be processed from left to right, considering that ui is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by si ends. For example, if ui=4 and si=__URLÂ», then the answer is 10."," The first line contains two integer numbers n and q (1_____1018, q__1). n is such that n+1 is a power of 2.

We will use (r,_) to denote a cell located in the row r and column c. Gosha is often invited somewhere. Every time he gets an invitation, he first calculates the number of ways to get to this place, and only then he goes. Gosha's house is located in the cell (1,1). At any moment of time, Gosha moves from the cell he is currently located in to a cell adjacent to it (two cells are adjacent if they share a common side). Of course, the movement is possible only if such a cell exists, i.e. Gosha will not go beyond the boundaries of the table. Thus, from the cell (r,_) he is able to make a move to one of the cells (r-1,_), (r,_-1), (r+1,_), (r,_+1). Also, Ghosha can skip a move and stay in the current cell (r,_). Besides the love of strange calculations, Gosha is allergic to cats, so he never goes to the cell that has a cat in it. Gosha knows exactly where and when he will be invited and the schedule of cats travelling along the table. Formally, he has q records, the i-th of them has one of the following forms: 1, xi, yi, ti   Gosha is invited to come to cell (xi,_i) at the moment of time ti.

Two ways to go from cell (1,1) to cell (x,_) at time t are considered distinct if for at least one moment of time from 1 to t Gosha's positions are distinct for the two ways at this moment.

It's widely known that each tree is occupied by a single crow family. The trees in the alley form a row and are numbered from 1 to n. Some families are friends to each other. For some reasons, two families can be friends only if they live not too far from each other, more precisely, there is no more than k-1 trees between any pair of friend families. Formally, the family on the u-th tree and the family on the v-th tree can be friends only if |u-_|___ holds. One of the friendship features is that if some family learns that Timofey is feeding crows somewhere, it notifies about this all friend families. Thus, after Timofey starts to feed crows under some tree, all the families that are friends to the family living on this tree, as well as their friends and so on, fly to the feeding place. Of course, the family living on the tree also comes to the feeding place. Today Timofey came to the alley and noticed that all the families that live on trees with numbers strictly less than l or strictly greater than r have flown away.

Sometimes (or quite often) there are teachers who do not like you. Incidentally Noora also has one such teacher. His name is Yury Dmitrievich and he teaches graph theory. Yury Dmitrievich doesn't like Noora, so he always gives the girl the most difficult tasks. So it happened this time. The teacher gives Noora a tree with n vertices. Vertices are numbered with integers from 1 to n. The length of all the edges of this tree is 1. Noora chooses a set of simple paths that pairwise don't intersect in edges. However each vertex should belong to at least one of the selected path. For each of the selected paths, the following is done: We choose exactly one edge (u,_) that belongs to the path. On the selected edge (u,_) there is a point at some selected distance x from the vertex u and at distance 1-_ from vertex v. But the distance x chosen by Noora arbitrarily, i. e. it can be different for different edges. One of the vertices u or v is selected. The point will start moving to the selected vertex. Let us explain how the point moves by example. Suppose that the path consists of two edges (v1,_2) and (v2,_3), the point initially stands on the edge (v1,_2) and begins its movement to the vertex v1. Then the point will reach v1, then ""turn around"", because the end of the path was reached, further it will move in another direction to vertex v2, then to vertex v3, then ""turn around"" again, then move to v2 and so on. The speed of the points is 1 edge per second. For example, for 0.5 second the point moves to the length of the half of an edge. A stopwatch is placed at each vertex of the tree. The time that the stopwatches indicate at start time is 0 seconds. Then at the starting moment of time, all points simultaneously start moving from the selected positions to selected directions along the selected paths, and stopwatches are simultaneously started. When one of the points reaches the vertex v, the stopwatch at the vertex v is automatically reset, i.e. it starts counting the time from zero. Denote by resv the maximal time that the stopwatch at the vertex v will show if the point movement continues infinitely. Noora is asked to select paths and points on them so that res1 is as minimal as possible. If there are several solutions to do this, it is necessary to minimize res2, then res3, res4,...,_esn.

The machine works in a simple manner: it cuts k k flowers from the beginning of the liana, then another k k flowers and so on. Each such piece of k k flowers is called a workpiece. The machine works until there are less than k k flowers on the liana. Diana has found a weaving schematic for the most beautiful wreath imaginable. In order to weave it, k k flowers must contain flowers of types b 1 b , b 2 b , ..., b s b , while other can be of any type. If a type appears in this sequence several times, there should be at least that many flowers of that type as the number of occurrences of this flower in the sequence. The order of the flowers in a workpiece does not matter. Diana has a chance to remove some flowers from the liana before it is inserted into the cutting machine. She can remove flowers from any part of the liana without breaking liana into pieces. If Diana removes too many flowers, it may happen so that some of the citizens do not get a wreath. Could some flowers be removed from the liana so that at least one workpiece would conform to the schematic and machine would still be able to create at least n n workpieces?"," The first line contains four integers m m , k k , n n and s s ( 1_,k,m5 10 5 1 , k__ k , 1__ 1 ): the number of flowers on the liana, the number of flowers in one wreath, the amount of citizens and the length of Diana's flower sequence respectively.

There are n hills arranged on a line, each in the form of a vertical line segment with one endpoint on the ground. The hills are numbered with numbers from 1 to n from left to right. The i-th hill stands at position xi with its top at height yi. For every two hills a and b, if the top of hill a can be seen from the top of hill b, their tops are connected by a rope.

The first and the second climbers of the i-th team are located at the top of the ai-th and bi-th hills, respectively. They want to meet together at the top of some hill. Now, each of two climbers move according to the following process: if a climber is at the top of the hill where the other climber is already located or will come eventually, the former climber stays at this hill; otherwise, the climber picks a hill to the right of his current hill that is reachable by a rope and is the rightmost possible, climbs this hill and continues the process (the climber can also climb a hill whose top is lower than the top of his current hill).

This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java   call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal   flush(output). Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind. On a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed. Then the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are ""bulls"", if on different positions, they are ""cows"". Thus a response is a pair of numbers   the number of ""bulls"" and the number of ""cows"". A try can contain equal digits. More formally, let's the secret string is s and the second player are trying to guess it with a string x. The number of ""bulls"" is a number of such positions i (1_____4) where s[i]=_[i]. The number of ""cows"" is a number of such digits c that s contains c in the position i (i.e. s[i]=_), x contains c, but x[i]___. For example, the secret string is ""0427"", the opponent's try is ""0724"", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are ""0"" and ""2"", the cows are ""4"" and ""7""). If the secret string is ""0123"", the opponent's try is ""0330"", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow. In this problem you are to guess the string s that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits. You can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals ""4 0"", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate.

Every task i has an integer number ai associated with it denoting how many man-hours are required to complete the i-th task.

Kuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity. The paper is divided into n n pieces enumerated from 1 1 to n n . Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the i i -th piece has color c i c where c i =0 c defines black color, c i =1 c defines white color and c i =1 c means that the piece hasn't been colored yet. The rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ( 0 0 or 1 1 ) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, [1010] [ , [0101] [ , [1] [ , [0] [ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece x x to piece y y if and only if there is an arrow from x x to y y .

1553,"'Jeopardy!' is an intellectual game where players answer questions and earn points. Company Q conducts a simplified 'Jeopardy!' tournament among the best IT companies. By a lucky coincidence, the old rivals made it to the finals: company R1 and company R2. The finals will have n questions, m of them are auction questions and n-_ of them are regular questions. Each question has a price. The price of the i-th question is ai points. During the game the players chose the questions. At that, if the question is an auction, then the player who chose it can change the price if the number of his current points is strictly larger than the price of the question. The new price of the question cannot be less than the original price and cannot be greater than the current number of points of the player who chose the question. The correct answer brings the player the points equal to the price of the question. The wrong answer to the question reduces the number of the player's points by the value of the question price.

3678,"Instructors of Some Informatics School make students go to bed. The house contains n rooms, in each room exactly b students were supposed to sleep. However, at the time of curfew it happened that many students are not located in their assigned rooms. The rooms are arranged in a row and numbered from 1 to n. Initially, in i-th room there are ai students. All students are currently somewhere in the house, therefore a1+_2+...+_n=_b. Also 2 instructors live in this house. The process of curfew enforcement is the following. One instructor starts near room 1 and moves toward room n, while the second instructor starts near room n and moves toward room 1. After processing current room, each instructor moves on to the next one. Both instructors enter rooms and move simultaneously, if n is odd, then only the first instructor processes the middle room. When all rooms are processed, the process ends. When an instructor processes a room, she counts the number of students in the room, then turns off the light, and locks the room. Also, if the number of students inside the processed room is not equal to b, the instructor writes down the number of this room into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room). Instructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day), so they don't care about who is in the room, but only about the number of students. While instructors are inside the rooms, students can run between rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can run by at most d rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that differs my at most d. Also, after (or instead of) running each student can hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor will not count her during the processing. In each room any number of students can hide simultaneously. Formally, here is what's happening: A curfew is announced, at this point in room i there are ai students. Each student can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her initial room, or stay in place. After that each student can optionally hide under a bed. Instructors enter room 1 and room n, they count students there and lock the room (after it no one can enter or leave this room). Each student from rooms with numbers from 2 to n-1 can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her current room, or stay in place. Each student can optionally hide under a bed. Instructors move from room 1 to room 2 and from room n to room n-1. This process continues until all rooms are processed. Let x1 denote the number of rooms in which the first instructor counted the number of non-hidden students different from b, and x2 be the same number for the second instructor.

Every cell is either allowed (denoted by '.' in the input) or permanently blocked (denoted by '#'). Bearland is a cold land, where heavy snow often makes travelling harder. Every day a few allowed cells are temporarily blocked by snow. Note, that this block works only on this particular day and next day any of these cells might be allowed again (unless there is another temporarily block). It's possible to move directly between two cells only if they share a side and none of them is permanently or temporarily blocked. Limak is a little polar bear who lives in Bearland. His house is at the top left cell, while his school is at the bottom right cell. Every day Limak should first go from his house to the school and then return back to his house. Since he gets bored easily, he doesn't want to visit the same cell twice on one day, except for the cell with his house, where he starts and ends. If Limak can reach a school and return home avoiding revisiting cells, he calls a day interesting. There are q days you must process, one after another.

As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of n brains and m brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together.

She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row.

So the City has electricity if it has a power station in it or it is connected to a City which has electricity by a direct connection or via a chain of connections.

2406,"Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face. One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget   a rotating camera   come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification? But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical. Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation   to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized. Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

2746,"One tradition of ACM-ICPC contests is that a team gets a balloon for every solved problem. We assume that the submission time doesn't matter and teams are sorted only by the number of balloons they have. It means that one's place is equal to the number of teams with more balloons, increased by 1. For example, if there are seven teams with more balloons, you get the eight place. Ties are allowed. You should know that it's important to eat before a contest. If the number of balloons of a team is greater than the weight of this team, the team starts to float in the air together with their workstation.

33,"In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system. There are n n officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer a a is the direct superior of officer b b , then we also can say that officer b b is a direct subordinate of officer a a . Officer x x is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer y y if one of the following conditions holds: officer y y is the direct superior of officer x x ; the direct superior of officer x x is a subordinate of officer y y . For example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer 3 3 are: 5,6,7,8,9 5 . The structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army. Formally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of n n vertices, in which vertex u u corresponds to officer u u . The parent of vertex u u corresponds to the direct superior of officer u u . The root (which has index 1 1 ) corresponds to the commander of the army. Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on q q queries, the i i -th query is given as ( u i , k i ) ( , where u i u is some officer, and k i k is a positive integer. To process the i i -th query imagine how a command from u i u spreads to the subordinates of u i u . Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here. Suppose the current officer is a a and he spreads a command. Officer a a chooses b b  one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then a a chooses the one having minimal index. Officer a a gives a command to officer b b . Afterwards, b b uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After b b finishes spreading the command, officer a a chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer a a cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer a a finishes spreading the command. Let's look at the following example: If officer 1 1 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [1,2,3,5,6,8,7,9,4] [ . If officer 3 3 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [3,5,6,8,7,9] [ . If officer 7 7 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [7,9] [ . If officer 9 9 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [9] [ .

2028,"Vova and Marina love offering puzzles to each other. Today Marina offered Vova to cope with the following task. Vova has a non-directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges without loops and multiple edges. Let's define the operation of contraction two vertices a and b that are not connected by an edge. As a result of this operation vertices a and b are deleted and instead of them a new vertex x is added into the graph, and also edges are drawn from it to all vertices that were connected with a or with b (specifically, if the vertex was connected with both a and b, then also exactly one edge is added from x to it). Thus, as a result of contraction again a non-directed graph is formed, it contains no loops nor multiple edges, and it contains (n-1) vertices. Vova must perform the contraction an arbitrary number of times to transform the given graph into a chain of the maximum length. A chain of length k (k__0) is a connected graph whose vertices can be numbered with integers from 1 to k+1 so that the edges of the graph connect all pairs of vertices (i,_+1) (1______) and only them. Specifically, the graph that consists of one vertex is a chain of length 0. The vertices that are formed as a result of the contraction are allowed to be used in the following operations of contraction. The picture illustrates the contraction of two vertices marked by red.

828,"Heidi found out that the Daleks have created a network of bidirectional Time Corridors connecting different destinations (at different times!). She suspects that they are planning another invasion on the entire Space and Time. In order to counter the invasion, she plans to deploy a trap in the Time Vortex, along a carefully chosen Time Corridor. She knows that tinkering with the Time Vortex is dangerous, so she consulted the Doctor on how to proceed. She has learned the following: Different Time Corridors require different amounts of energy to keep stable. Daleks are unlikely to use all corridors in their invasion. They will pick a set of Corridors that requires the smallest total energy to maintain, yet still makes (time) travel possible between any two destinations (for those in the know: they will use a minimum spanning tree).

The total weight of all boxes on the platform cannot exceed the strength of platform S at any time. The strength of any box of the platform at any time must be no less than the total weight of the boxes that stand above. You can take only the topmost box from the platform.

Measuring time is a complex process related to usage of a special sensor and a time counter. Think of the front wheel of a bicycle as a circle of radius r. Let's neglect the thickness of a tire, the size of the sensor, and all physical effects. The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a circle of radius r. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle.

The cyclist makes a complete ride, moving with his maximum speed and at the moment the sensor's coordinate is equal to the coordinate of the finish (moment of time tfi), the time counter deactivates and records the final time.

At the beginning of each test the robot prototype will be placed in cell (x0,_0) of a rectangular squared field of size x___, after that a mine will be installed into one of the squares of the field. It is supposed to conduct exactly xÂ·y tests, each time a mine is installed into a square that has never been used before. The starting cell of the robot always remains the same. After placing the objects on the field the robot will have to run a sequence of commands given by string s, consisting only of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'. These commands tell the robot to move one square to the left, to the right, up or down, or stay idle if moving in the given direction is impossible.

But if at some moment of time the robot is at the same square with the mine, it will also blow up, but not due to a bug in the code.

There are n dominoes on a 2D Cartesian plane. i-th domino (1______) can be represented as a line segment which is parallel to the y-axis and whose length is li. The lower point of the domino is on the x-axis. Let's denote the x-coordinate of the i-th domino as pi. Dominoes are placed one after another, so p1<_2<...<_n-1<_n holds. User ainta wants to take a video of falling dominoes. To make dominoes fall, he can push a single domino to the right. Then, the domino will fall down drawing a circle-shaped orbit until the line segment totally overlaps with the x-axis. Also, if the s-th domino touches the t-th domino while falling down, the t-th domino will also fall down towards the right, following the same procedure above. Domino s touches domino t if and only if the segment representing s and t intersects. See the picture above. If he pushes the leftmost domino to the right, it falls down, touching dominoes (A), (B) and (C). As a result, dominoes (A), (B), (C) will also fall towards the right. However, domino (D) won't be affected by pushing the leftmost domino, but eventually it will fall because it is touched by domino (C) for the first time. The picture above is an example of falling dominoes. Each red circle denotes a touch of two dominoes. User ainta has q plans of posting the video. j-th of them starts with pushing the xj-th domino, and lasts until the yj-th domino falls. But sometimes, it could be impossible to achieve such plan, so he has to lengthen some dominoes. It costs one dollar to increase the length of a single domino by 1. User ainta wants to know, for each plan, the minimum cost needed to achieve it. Plans are processed independently, i. e. if domino's length is increased in some plan, it doesn't affect its length in other plans.

A ""01-string"" is a string that contains n n characters ""0"" and ""1"". For example, if n=4 n , strings ""0110"", ""0000"", and ""1110"" are ""01-strings"", but ""00110"" (there are 5 5 characters, not 4 4 ) and ""zero"" (unallowed characters) are not.

For example, in a GPS navigation software where a driver can query for a suggested route, or in a robot motion planning where it should find a valid sequence of movements to do some tasks, or in a simple maze solver where it should find a valid path from one point to another point. This problem is related to solving a maze. The maze considered in this problem is in the form of a matrix of integers A A of N_N N .

The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: Only one disk can be moved at a time. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves.

They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor. Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors. Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks. c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake! Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero: Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000 Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.

These relations are very important in many areas of mathematics. For example, the equality of the two numbers is an equivalence relation. A set  of pairs (a,_) of elements of some set A is called a binary relation on set A. For two elements a and b of the set A we say that they are in relation , if pair , in this case we use a notation . Binary relation is equivalence relation, if: It is reflexive (for any a it is true that ); It is symmetric (for any a, b it is true that if , then ); It is transitive (if and , than ). Little Johnny is not completely a fool and he noticed that the first condition is not necessary! Here is his ""proof"": Take any two elements, a and b.

The shop can make the refrigerator with any size of the door that meets the following restrictions: the refrigerator door must be rectangle, and both the length and the width of the door must be positive integers. Edo figured out how he wants to place the magnets on the refrigerator. He introduced a system of coordinates on the plane, where each magnet is represented as a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Now he wants to remove no more than k magnets (he may choose to keep all of them) and attach all remaining magnets to the refrigerator door, and the area of the door should be as small as possible. A magnet is considered to be attached to the refrigerator door if its center lies on the door or on its boundary. The relative positions of all the remaining magnets must correspond to the plan. Let us explain the last two sentences. Let's suppose we want to hang two magnets on the refrigerator. If the magnet in the plan has coordinates of the lower left corner (x1, y1) and the upper right corner (x2, y2), then its center is located at (, ) (may not be integers). By saying the relative position should correspond to the plan we mean that the only available operation is translation, i.e. the vector connecting the centers of two magnets in the original plan, must be equal to the vector connecting the centers of these two magnets on the refrigerator.

In each turn, one of the players makes a move (it doesn_ matter which player, it's possible that players turns do not alternate). Algorithm for bots that Sasha and Ira are developing works by keeping track of the state the game is in. Each time either bot makes a move, the state changes. And, since the game is very dynamic, it will never go back to the state it was already in at any point in the past.

911,"A team quiz game called ""What? Where? When?"" is very popular in Berland. The game is centered on two teams competing. They are the team of six Experts versus the team of the Audience. A person from the audience asks a question and the experts are allowed a minute on brainstorming and finding the right answer to the question. All it takes to answer a typical question is general knowledge and common logic. The question sent be the audience are in envelops lain out in a circle on a round table. Each envelop is marked by the name of the asker's town. Each question is positioned in a separate sector. In the centre of the table is a spinning arrow. Thus, the table rather resembles a roulette table with no ball but with a spinning arrow instead. The host sets off the spinning arrow to choose a question for the experts: when the arrow stops spinning, the question it is pointing at is chosen.

1210,"Reforms have started in Berland again! At this time, the Parliament is discussing the reform of the calendar. To make the lives of citizens of Berland more varied, it was decided to change the calendar. As more and more people are complaining that ""the years fly by..."", it was decided that starting from the next year the number of days per year will begin to grow. So the coming year will have exactly a days, the next after coming year will have a+1 days, the next one will have a+2 days and so on. This schedule is planned for the coming n years (in the n-th year the length of the year will be equal a+_-1 day). No one has yet decided what will become of months. An MP Palevny made the following proposal. The calendar for each month is comfortable to be printed on a square sheet of paper. We are proposed to make the number of days in each month be the square of some integer. The number of days per month should be the same for each month of any year, but may be different for different years. The number of days in each year must be divisible by the number of days per month in this year. This rule ensures that the number of months in each year is an integer. The number of days per month for each year must be chosen so as to save the maximum amount of paper to print the calendars. In other words, the number of days per month should be as much as possible. These rules provide an unambiguous method for choosing the number of days in each month for any given year length. For example, according to Palevny's proposition, a year that consists of 108 days will have three months, 36 days each. The year that consists of 99 days will have 11 months, 9 days each, and a year of 365 days will have 365 months, one day each. The proposal provoked heated discussion in the community, the famous mathematician Perelmanov quickly calculated that if the proposal is supported, then in a period of n years, beginning with the year that has a days, the country will spend p sheets of paper to print a set of calendars for these years. Perelmanov's calculations take into account the fact that the set will contain one calendar for each year and each month will be printed on a separate sheet. Repeat Perelmanov's achievement and print the required number p. You are given positive integers a and n.

A parenthesis sequence is a string, containing only characters ""("" and "")"". A correct parenthesis sequence is a parenthesis sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters ""1"" and ""+"" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, parenthesis sequences ""()()"", ""(())"" are correct (the resulting expressions are: ""(1+1)+(1+1)"", ""((1+1)+1)""), while "")("" and "")"" are not.

386,"International Coding Procedures Company (ICPC) writes all its code in Jedi Script (JS) programming language. JS does not get compiled, but is delivered for execution in its source form. Sources contain comments, extra whitespace (including trailing and leading spaces), and other non-essential features that make them quite large but do not contribute to the semantics of the code, so the process of minification is performed on source files before their delivery to execution to compress sources while preserving their semantics. You are hired by ICPC to write JS minifier for ICPC. Fortunately, ICPC adheres to very strict programming practices and their JS sources are quite restricted in grammar. They work only on integer algorithms and do not use floating point numbers and strings. Every JS source contains a sequence of lines. Each line contains zero or more tokens that can be separated by spaces. On each line, a part of the line that starts with a hash character ('#' code 35), including the hash character itself, is treated as a comment and is ignored up to the end of the line. Each line is parsed into a sequence of tokens from left to right by repeatedly skipping spaces and finding the longest possible token starting at the current parsing position, thus transforming the source code into a sequence of tokens. All the possible tokens are listed below: A reserved token is any kind of operator, separator, literal, reserved word, or a name of a library function that should be preserved during the minification process. Reserved tokens are fixed strings of non-space ASCII characters that do not contain the hash character ('#' code 35). All reserved tokens are given as an input to the minification process. A number token consists of a sequence of digits, where a digit is a character from zero ('0') to nine ('9') inclusive. A word token consists of a sequence of characters from the following set: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, underscore ('_' code 95), and dollar sign ('$' code 36). A word does not start with a digit. Note, that during parsing the longest sequence of characters that satisfies either a number or a word definition, but that appears in the list of reserved tokens, is considered to be a reserved token instead. During the minification process words are renamed in a systematic fashion using the following algorithm: Take a list of words that consist only of lowercase letters ordered first by their length, then lexicographically: ""a"", ""b"", ..., ""z"", ""aa"", ""ab"", ..., excluding reserved tokens, since they are not considered to be words. This is the target word list. Rename the first word encountered in the input token sequence to the first word in the target word list and all further occurrences of the same word in the input token sequence, too. Rename the second new word encountered in the input token sequence to the second word in the target word list, and so on. The goal of the minification process is to convert the given source to the shortest possible line (counting spaces) that still parses to the same sequence of tokens with the correspondingly renamed words using these JS parsing rules."," The first line of the input contains a single integer n n ( 0_40 0 )  the number of reserved tokens. The second line of the input contains the list of reserved tokens separated by spaces without repetitions in the list. Each reserved token is at least one and at most 20 characters long and contains only characters with ASCII codes from 33 (exclamation mark) to 126 (tilde) inclusive, with exception of a hash character ('#' code 35). The third line of the input contains a single integer m m ( 1_40 1 )  the number of lines in the input source code. Next m m lines contain the input source, each source line is at most 80 characters long (counting leading and trailing spaces).

The source code is valid and fully parses into a sequence of tokens.","Write to the output a single line that is the result of the minification process on the input source code.

Today, the online news thundered with terrible information. The R1 database crashed and almost no data could be saved except for one big string. The developers assume that the string contains the letters of some users of the R1 mail. Recovering letters is a tedious mostly manual work. So before you start this process, it was decided to estimate the difficulty of recovering. Namely, we need to calculate the number of different substrings of the saved string that form correct e-mail addresses. We assume that valid addresses are only the e-mail addresses which meet the following criteria: the address should begin with a non-empty sequence of letters, numbers, characters '_', starting with a letter; then must go character '@'; then must go a non-empty sequence of letters or numbers; then must go character '.'; the address must end with a non-empty sequence of letters. You got lucky again and the job was entrusted to you! Please note that the substring is several consecutive characters in a string. Two substrings, one consisting of the characters of the string with numbers l1,_1+1,_1+2,...,_1 and the other one consisting of the characters of the string with numbers l2,_2+1,_2+2,...,_2, are considered distinct if l1___2 or r1___2."," The first and the only line contains the sequence of characters s1s2... sn (1_____106)   the saved string.

The bus system in the capital of Berland is arranged in such a way that each bus runs along the route between two stops. Each bus has no intermediate stops.

1566,"Polycarpus develops an interesting theory about the interrelation of arithmetic progressions with just everything in the world. His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression. Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions. Polycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a1,_2,...,_n, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8,6,4,2,1,4,7,10,2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8,6,4,2), (1,4,7,10) and (2), which are written one after another. Unfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of ai may be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1. For a given sequence a=(a1,_2,...,_n), which consists of positive integers and values -1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values -1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values ai>0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.

868,"Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from 1 1 to 9 9 ). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m,   , 9m, 1p, 2p,   , 9p, 1s, 2s,   , 9s. In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand. Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win? Here are some useful definitions in this game: A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu; A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu; A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples: [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s]  it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu; [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p]  it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu; [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p]  it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu.

Students like to dream of a beautiful life, so they used champagne glasses to construct a small pyramid. The height of the pyramid is n. The top level consists of only 1 glass, that stands on 2 glasses on the second level (counting from the top), then 3 glasses on the third level and so on.The bottom level consists of n glasses. Vlad has seen in the movies many times how the champagne beautifully flows from top levels to bottom ones, filling all the glasses simultaneously. So he took a bottle and started to pour it in the glass located at the top of the pyramid. Each second, Vlad pours to the top glass the amount of champagne equal to the size of exactly one glass. If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table. For the purpose of this problem we consider that champagne is distributed among pyramid glasses immediately. Vlad is interested in the number of completely full glasses if he stops pouring champagne in t seconds.

There is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower.

A block may consist of a single castle. The partitioning is chosen in such a way that every castle is a part of exactly one block. Each block is sorted independently from other blocks, that is the sequence hi,_i+1,...,_j becomes sorted.

The lowest-price SELL order and the highest-price BUY order are called the best offers, marked with black frames on the picture below. The presented order book says that someone wants to sell the product at price 12 12 and it's the best SELL offer because the other two have higher prices. The best BUY offer has price 10 10 .

It's impossible to accept not the best SELL or BUY offer (to make a deal at worse price). After someone accepts the offer, it is removed from the orderbook forever.

Also, two strange rays will start propagating from the bomb with speed s: one to the right, and one to the left. Of course, the speed s is strictly greater than people's maximum speed.

In this problem all lists have linear structure. I.e. each element except the first has exactly one previous element, each element except the last has exactly one next element. The list is not closed in a cycle. In this problem you are given n memory cells forming one or more doubly linked lists. Each cell contains information about element from some list.

The alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large version of a letter x is denoted by x'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but all large letters are before all small letters. For example, the following conditions hold: 2<3, 2'<3', 3'<2. A word x1,_2,...,_a is not lexicographically greater than y1,_2,...,_b if one of the two following conditions holds: a___ and x1=_1,...,_a=_a, i.e. the first word is the prefix of the second word; there is a position 1______in(a,_), such that x1=_1,...,_j-1=_j-1 and xj<_j, i.e. at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has.

A part of the algorithm is a procedure that computes Haar features. As part of this task, we consider a simplified model of this concept. Let's consider a rectangular image that is represented with a table of size n___. The table elements are integers that specify the brightness of each pixel in the image. A feature also is a rectangular table of size n___. Each cell of a feature is painted black or white. To calculate the value of the given feature at the given image, you must perform the following steps. First the table of the feature is put over the table of the image (without rotations or reflections), thus each pixel is entirely covered with either black or white cell. The value of a feature in the image is the value of W-_, where W is the total brightness of the pixels in the image, covered with white feature cells, and B is the total brightness of the pixels covered with black feature cells. Some examples of the most popular Haar features are given below. Your task is to determine the number of operations that are required to calculate the feature by using the so-called prefix rectangles. A prefix rectangle is any rectangle on the image, the upper left corner of which coincides with the upper left corner of the image. You have a variable value, whose value is initially zero. In one operation you can count the sum of pixel values at any prefix rectangle, multiply it by any integer and add to variable value. You are given a feature.

2927,"Mahmoud wants to write a new dictionary that contains n words and relations between them. There are two types of relations: synonymy (i. e. the two words mean the same) and antonymy (i. e. the two words mean the opposite). From time to time he discovers a new relation between two words. He know that if two words have a relation between them, then each of them has relations with the words that has relations with the other. For example, if like means love and love is the opposite of hate, then like is also the opposite of hate. One more example: if love is the opposite of hate and hate is the opposite of like, then love means like, and so on. Sometimes Mahmoud discovers a wrong relation. A wrong relation is a relation that makes two words equal and opposite at the same time. For example if he knows that love means like and like is the opposite of hate, and then he figures out that hate means like, the last relation is absolutely wrong because it makes hate and like opposite and have the same meaning at the same time. After Mahmoud figured out many relations, he was worried that some of them were wrong so that they will make other relations also wrong, so he decided to tell every relation he figured out to his coder friend Ehab and for every relation he wanted to know is it correct or wrong, basing on the previously discovered relations.

340,"Everyone knows that computers become faster and faster. Recently Berland scientists have built a machine that can move itself back in time! More specifically, it works as follows. It has an infinite grid and a robot which stands on one of the cells. Each cell of the grid can either be empty or contain 0 or 1. The machine also has a program which consists of instructions, which are being handled one by one. Each instruction is represented by exactly one symbol (letter or digit) and takes exactly one unit of time (say, second) to be performed, except the last type of operation (it's described below). Here they are: 0 or 1: the robot places this number into the cell he is currently at. If this cell wasn't empty before the operation, its previous number is replaced anyway. e: the robot erases the number into the cell he is at. l, r, u or d: the robot goes one cell to the left/right/up/down. s: the robot stays where he is for a unit of time. t: let x x be 0 0 , if the cell with the robot is empty, otherwise let x x be one more than the digit in this cell (that is, x=1 x if the digit in this cell is 0 0 , and x=2 x if the digit is 1 1 ). Then the machine travels x x seconds back in time. Note that this doesn't change the instructions order, but it changes the position of the robot and the numbers in the grid as they were x x units of time ago. You can consider this instruction to be equivalent to a Ctrl-Z pressed x x times. For example, let the board be completely empty, and the program be sr1t0. Let the robot initially be at (0,0) ( . [now is the moment 0 0 , the command is s]: we do nothing. [now is the moment 1 1 , the command is r]: we are now at (1,0) ( . [now is the moment 2 2 , the command is 1]: we are at (1,0) ( , and this cell contains 1 1 . [now is the moment 3 3 , the command is t]: we travel 1+1=2 1 moments back, that is, to the moment 1 1 . [now is the moment 1 1 , the command is 0]: we are again at (0,0) ( , and the board is clear again, but after we follow this instruction, this cell has 0 0 in it. We've just rewritten the history. The consequences of the third instruction have never happened. Now Berland scientists want to use their machine in practice. For example, they want to be able to add two integers. Assume that the initial state of the machine is as follows: One positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,1) ( , from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit. The other positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,0) ( , from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit. All the other cells are empty. The robot is at (0,0) ( . We consider this state to be always in the past; that is, if you manage to travel to any negative moment, the board was always as described above, and the robot was at (0,0) ( for eternity. You are asked to write a program after which The robot stands on a non-empty cell, If we read the number starting from the cell with the robot and moving to the right until the first empty cell, this will be a+b a in binary, from the highest bit to the lowest bit. Note that there are no restrictions on other cells. In particular, there may be a digit just to the left to the robot after all instructions.

Analysts have found that during the holidays, major sporting events and other significant events users begin to enter the network more frequently, resulting in great load increase on the infrastructure. As part of this task, we assume that the social network is 4n processes running on the n servers. All servers are absolutely identical machines, each of which has a volume of RAM of 1 GB = 1024 MB (1). Each process takes 100 MB of RAM on the server. At the same time, the needs of maintaining the viability of the server takes about 100 more megabytes of RAM. Thus, each server may have up to 9 different processes of social network. Now each of the n servers is running exactly 4 processes. However, at the moment of peak load it is sometimes necessary to replicate the existing 4n processes by creating 8n new processes instead of the old ones. More formally, there is a set of replication rules, the i-th (1_____4n) of which has the form of ai__(bi,_i), where ai, bi and ci (1___i,_i,_i___) are the numbers of servers. This means that instead of an old process running on server ai, there should appear two new copies of the process running on servers bi and ci.

Also there are n n wires numbered from 1 1 to n n , each connecting two distinct contact points on the board. An electric signal can pass between wires A A and B B if: either both wires share the same contact point; or there is a sequence of wires starting with A A and ending with B B , and each pair of adjacent wires in the sequence share a contact point. The picture shows a circuit board with 5 5 wires. Contact points with numbers 2,5,7,8,10,13 2 are used. Here an electrical signal can pass from wire 2 2 to wire 3 3 , but not to wire 1 1 . Currently the circuit board is broken. Polycarpus thinks that the board could be fixed if the wires were re-soldered so that a signal could pass between any pair of wires.

Any contact point from range [1, 10 9 ] [ can be used as a new contact point. A wire's ends must always be soldered to distinct contact points.

However, the multiverse itself works in mysterious ways. Well, it works using probabilities, which to some people is mysterious. At each unit time, when a decision is made, one of the two events will happen randomly. Let's denote l l as the current length of the multiverse. With a probability of p create =1 l m p , a universe will be created. With a probability of p break = l m p , a non-existent link will be broken at some position.

Otherwise there will be no any exclusivity. So Cicasso will entirely hold the world tour in his native country   Berland. Cicasso is very devoted to his work and he wants to be distracted as little as possible. Therefore he will visit only four cities. These cities will be different, so no one could think that he has ""favourites"". Of course, to save money, he will chose the shortest paths between these cities. But as you have probably guessed, Cicasso is a weird person. Although he doesn't like to organize exhibitions, he likes to travel around the country and enjoy its scenery. So he wants the total distance which he will travel to be as large as possible. However, the sculptor is bad in planning, so he asks you for help. There are n cities and m one-way roads in Berland.

Four cities in the order of visiting marked as overlines: [1,5,2,4]. Note that Berland is a high-tech country. So using nanotechnologies all roads were altered so that they have the same length.

He has recently read an encyclopedia article that described the method of median smoothing (or median filter) and its many applications in science and engineering. Vasya liked the idea of the method very much, and he decided to try it in practice. Applying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence of numbers a1,_2,...,_n will result a new sequence b1,_2,...,_n obtained by the following algorithm: b1=_1, bn=_n, that is, the first and the last number of the new sequence match the corresponding numbers of the original sequence. For i=2,...,_-1 value bi is equal to the median of three values ai-1, ai and ai+1. The median of a set of three numbers is the number that goes on the second place, when these three numbers are written in the non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1. In order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only. Having made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to it. Now Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable.

Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband. The sequence of n n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 1 to n n exactly once. The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). A subsequence a i 1 , a i 2 ,, a i k a where 1 i 1 < i 2 << i k _ 1 is called increasing if a i 1 < a i 2 < a i 3 << a i k a . If a i 1 > a i 2 > a i 3 >> a i k a , a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences. For example, if there is a permutation [6,4,1,7,2,3,5] [ , LIS of this permutation will be [1,2,3,5] [ , so the length of LIS is equal to 4 4 . LDS can be [6,4,1] [ , [6,4,2] [ , or [6,4,3] [ , so the length of LDS is 3 3 . Note, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.

1161,"A forestation is an act of planting a bunch of trees to grow a forest, usually to replace a forest that had been cut down. Strangely enough, graph theorists have another idea on how to make a forest, i.e. by cutting down a tree! A tree is a graph of N N nodes connected by N1 N edges. Let u u be a node in a tree U U which degree is at least 2 2 (i.e. directly connected to at least 2 2 other nodes in U U ). If we remove u u from U U , then we will get two or more disconnected (smaller) trees, or also known as forest by graph theorists. In this problem, we are going to investigate a special forestation of a tree done by graph theorists. Let V(S) V be the set of nodes in a tree S S and V(T) V be the set of nodes in a tree T T . Tree S S and tree T T are identical if there exists a bijection f:V(S)_(T) f such that for all pairs of nodes ( s i , s j ) ( in V(S) V , s i s and s j s is connected by an edge in S S if and only if node f( s i ) f and f( s j ) f is connected by an edge in T T . Note that f(s)=t f implies node s s in S S corresponds to node t t in T T . We call a node u u in a tree U U as a good cutting point if and only if the removal of u u from U U causes two or more disconnected trees, and all those disconnected trees are pairwise identical. Given a tree U U , your task is to determine whether there exists a good cutting point in U U . If there is such a node, then you should output the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point. For example, consider the following tree of 13 13 nodes. There is exactly one good cutting point in this tree, i.e. node 4 4 . Observe that by removing node 4 4 , we will get three identical trees (in this case, line graphs), i.e. {5,1,7,13} { , {8,2,11,6} { , and {3,12,9,10} { , which are denoted by A A , B B , and C C respectively in the figure.

One of them is as follows: Given two sequences a and b of length n each you need to write a sequence c of length n, the i-th element of which is calculated as follows: ci=_i-_i. About sequences a and b we know that their elements are in the range from l to r. More formally, elements satisfy the following conditions: l___i___ and l___i___. About sequence c we know that all its elements are distinct. Dasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly, but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy. Due to an error in the test system only the sequence a and the compressed sequence of the sequence c were known from that test. Let's give the definition to a compressed sequence. A compressed sequence of sequence c of length n is a sequence p of length n, so that pi equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to ci in the sequence c.

We know for the i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time ti seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than vi meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than a meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.

1982,"Optimizing the amount of data transmitted via a network is an important and interesting part of developing any network application. In one secret game developed deep in the ZeptoLab company, the game universe consists of n levels, located in a circle. You can get from level i to levels i-1 and i+1, also you can get from level 1 to level n and vice versa. The map of the i-th level description size is ai bytes. In order to reduce the transmitted traffic, the game gets levels as follows. All the levels on the server are divided into m groups and each time a player finds himself on one of the levels of a certain group for the first time, the server sends all levels of the group to the game client as a single packet. Thus, when a player travels inside the levels of a single group, the application doesn't need any new information. Due to the technical limitations the packet can contain an arbitrary number of levels but their total size mustn't exceed b bytes, where b is some positive integer constant. Usual situation is that players finish levels one by one, that's why a decision was made to split n levels into m groups so that each group was a continuous segment containing multiple neighboring levels (also, the group can have two adjacent levels, n and 1). Specifically, if the descriptions of all levels have the total weight of at most b bytes, then they can all be united into one group to be sent in a single packet. Determine, what minimum number of groups do you need to make in order to organize the levels of the game observing the conditions above?

2078,"Let's define the permutation of length n as an array p=[p1,_2,...,_n] consisting of n distinct integers from range from 1 to n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on. Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p=[4,1,6,2,5,3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,1,6,2,5,3] is (421)(5)(63). Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,1,6,2,5,3] will become [4,2,1,5,6,3]. Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order.

The union of T T for all robots is equal to the set of all junctions in ICPC town. On the other hand, no two robots share a common junction, i.e. T i  T j = T if i_ i . To avoid complaints from citizens for an inefficient operation, the deployment plan should be irreducible; in other words, there should be no two robots, i i and j j , such that T i  T j T forms a (longer) path. Note that the agency does not care whether the number of robots being used is minimized as long as all the tasks are irreducible. Your task in this problem is to count the number of feasible deployment plan given the town's layout. A plan is feasible if and only if it satisfies all the above-mentioned requirements. For example, let N=6 N and the roads are {(1,3),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(4,6)} { . There are 5 5 feasible deployment plans as shown in the following figure. The first plan uses 2 2 robots (labeled as A and B in the figure) to clean {1,2,3} { and {4,5,6} { . The second plan uses 3 3 robots (labeled as A, B, and C in the figure) to clean {1,3,4,6} { , {2} { , and {5} { . The third plan uses 3 3 robots to clean {1,3,4,5} { , {2} { , and {6} { . The fourth plan uses 3 3 robots to clean {1} { , {2,3,4,6} { , and {5} { . The fifth plan uses 3 3 robots to clean {1} { , {2,3,4,5} { , and {6} { . No other plans are feasible in this case. For example, the plan {{1,3},{2},{4,5,6}} { is not feasible as the task {1,3} { and {2} { can be combined into a longer path {1,3,2} { . The plan {{1,2,3,4},{5},{6}} { is also not feasible as {1,2,3,4} { is not a path.",  begins with a line containing an integer: N N ( 1_100000 1 ) representing the number of junctions.

Each tower is represented by a point on the plane with coordinates (x,_), and the distance between two points with coordinates (x1,_1) and (x2,_2) is determined in this kingdom as |x1-_2|+|y1-_2|.

2289,"After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer! Some days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his n students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation. Unfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked. Now the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers. Shapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include ""-"", "";"" and ""_"". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong.

The time to enjoy those around them is so little that some even stand in queues to several rooms at the same time in the clinic, running from one queue to another. (Cultural note: standing in huge and disorganized queues for hours is a native tradition in Russia, dating back to the Soviet period. Queues can resemble crowds rather than lines. Not to get lost in such a queue, a person should follow a strict survival technique: you approach the queue and ask who the last person is, somebody answers and you join the crowd. Now you're the last person in the queue till somebody else shows up. You keep an eye on the one who was last before you as he is your only chance to get to your destination) I'm sure many people have had the problem when a stranger asks who the last person in the queue is and even dares to hint that he will be the last in the queue and then bolts away to some unknown destination. These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series. Such people often create problems in queues, because the newcomer does not see the last person in the queue and takes a place after the ""virtual"" link in this chain, wondering where this legendary figure has left.

Having stood for about three hours in the queue, the Smart Beaver realized that many beavers had not seen who was supposed to stand in the queue before them and there was a huge mess. He came up to each beaver in the ECG room queue and asked who should be in front of him in the queue. If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...

The supercollider he is building requires four-way orthogonal collisions of particles traveling at the same speed, so it will consist of four accelerating chambers and be shaped like a plus sign (i.e., +).

3271,"The Floral Clock has been standing by the side of Mirror Lake for years. Though unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old days. On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For each colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and v are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well   symmetry is beautiful! Formally, the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or semicircle) between them. Below is a possible arrangement with n=6 that cover all possibilities. The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour. In other words, in order to compute the beauty, we remove from the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to them. Then, the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments. Note that we include segments of length 0 in this product. If there are no flowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them, the beauty equals 0. For instance, the beauty of the above arrangement equals 1__3__1__3=9   the segments are {2}, {4,5,6}, {8} and {10,11,12}.

Each engine is defined by its velocity vector whose coordinates are (vxi,_yi) measured in distance units per day. An engine may be turned on at any level wi, that is a real number between -1 and +1 (inclusive) that result in a term of (wiÂ·vxi,_iÂ·vyi) in the final car velocity.

2312,"Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines. In order to make it work, you need to tie it to some point that it does not cover, and then switch it on. As a result it will go along a circle around this point and will remove all the snow from its path. Formally, we assume that Peter's machine is a polygon on a plane. Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon). That is, each of the points lying within or on the border of the polygon will move along the circular trajectory, with the center of the circle at the point to which Peter tied his machine.

Walking from intersection number i to intersection j requires |i-_| units of energy. The total energy spent by Mike to visit a sequence of intersections p1=1,_2,...,_k is equal to units of energy.

The city officials decided to prepare for the Olympics thoroughly and to build all the necessary Olympic facilities as early as possible. First, a biathlon track will be built. To construct a biathlon track a plot of land was allocated, which is a rectangle divided into n___ identical squares. Each of the squares has two coordinates: the number of the row (from 1 to n), where it is located, the number of the column (from 1 to m), where it is located. Also each of the squares is characterized by its height. During the sports the biathletes will have to move from one square to another. If a biathlete moves from a higher square to a lower one, he makes a descent. If a biathlete moves from a lower square to a higher one, he makes an ascent. If a biathlete moves between two squares with the same height, then he moves on flat ground. The biathlon track should be a border of some rectangular area of the allocated land on which biathletes will move in the clockwise direction. It is known that on one move on flat ground an average biathlete spends tp seconds, an ascent takes tu seconds, a descent takes td seconds. The Tomsk Administration wants to choose the route so that the average biathlete passes it in as close to t seconds as possible. In other words, the difference between time ts of passing the selected track and t should be minimum. For a better understanding you can look at the first sample of the input data. In this sample n=6,_=7, and the administration wants the track covering time to be as close to t=48 seconds as possible, also, tp=3, tu=6 and td=2.

The upper left corner of this track is located in the square with the row number 4, column number 3 and the lower right corner is at square with row number 6, column number 7.

An active startup can have arbitrarily many acquired startups that are following it. An active startup cannot follow any other startup. The following steps happen until there is exactly one active startup. The following sequence of steps takes exactly 1 day. Two distinct active startups A A , B B , are chosen uniformly at random. A fair coin is flipped, and with equal probability, A A acquires B B or B B acquires A A (i.e. if A A acquires B B , then that means B B 's state changes from active to acquired, and its starts following A A ). When a startup changes from active to acquired, all of its previously acquired startups become active. For example, the following scenario can happen: Let's say A A , B B are active startups. C C , D D , E E are acquired startups under A A , and F F , G G are acquired startups under B B : Active startups are shown in red. If A A acquires B B , then the state will be A A , F F , G G are active startups. C C , D D , E E , B B are acquired startups under A A .

1480,"You will receive 5 points for solving this problem. Manao has invented a new operation on strings that is called folding. Each fold happens between a pair of consecutive letters and places the second part of the string above first part, running in the opposite direction and aligned to the position of the fold. Using this operation, Manao converts the string into a structure that has one more level than there were fold operations performed. See the following examples for clarity. We will denote the positions of folds with '|' characters. For example, the word ""ABRACADABRA"" written as ""AB|RACA|DAB|RA"" indicates that it has been folded three times: first, between the leftmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters; second, between 'A' and 'D'; and third, between the rightmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters. Here are several examples of folded strings:  ""ABCDEF|GHIJK"" |  ""A|BCDEFGHIJK"" |  ""AB|RACA|DAB|RA"" |  ""X|XXXXX|X|X|XXXXXX""                |                 |                   |       XXXXXX     KJIHG      |   KJIHGFEDCB    |      AR           |       X    ABCDEF      |            A    |     DAB           |       X                |                 |     ACAR          |       XXXXX                |                 |       AB          |           X One last example for ""ABCD|EFGH|IJ|K"":   K IJ HGFE ABCD Manao noticed that each folded string can be viewed as several piles of letters.

After each update Ilya needs to find if the tree is anagrammable and if yes, find its anagramnity for each letter. Well, that's difficult to explain, but we'll try. To start with, a string a a is an anagram of a string b b if it is possible to rearrange letters in a a (without changing the letters itself) so that it becomes b b . For example, the string ""fortyfive"" is an anagram of the string ""overfifty"", but the string ""aabb"" is not an anagram of the string ""bbba"". Consider a path from the root of the tree to a leaf.

The organizers of the camp gave the gym leaders a PokeBlock, a sequence of n ingredients. Each ingredient can be of type 0 or 1. Now the organizers told the gym leaders that to evolve a Pokemon of type k (k__2), they need to make a valid set of k cuts on the PokeBlock to get smaller blocks. Suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is b0b1b2... bn-1. You have a choice of making cuts at n+1 places, i.e., Before b0, between b0 and b1, between b1 and b2, ..., between bn-2 and bn-1, and after bn-1. The n+1 choices of making cuts are as follows (where a | denotes a possible cut): | b0 | b1 | b2 | ... | bn-2 | bn-1 | Consider a sequence of k cuts. Now each pair of consecutive cuts will contain a binary string between them, formed from the ingredient types. The ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are wasted, which is to say they are not considered. So there will be exactly k-1 such binary substrings. Every substring can be read as a binary number. Let m be the maximum number out of the obtained numbers. If all the obtained numbers are positive and the set of the obtained numbers contains all integers from 1 to m, then this set of cuts is said to be a valid set of cuts. For example, suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is 101101001110 and we made 5 cuts in the following way: 10 | 11 | 010 | 01 | 1 | 10 So the 4 binary substrings obtained are: 11, 010, 01 and 1, which correspond to the numbers 3, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. Here m=3, as it is the maximum value among the obtained numbers. And all the obtained numbers are positive and we have obtained all integers from 1 to m. Hence this set of cuts is a valid set of 5 cuts. A Pokemon of type k will evolve only if the PokeBlock is cut using a valid set of k cuts. There can be many valid sets of the same size.
